    "Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) emit a compact, optically thick, mildly relativistic radio jet when they are in the hard and hard-intermediate states. In these states, BHBs exhibit a correlation between the time lag of hard photons with respect to softer ones and the photon index of the power law component that characterizes the X-ray spectral continuum above ∼ 10 keV. The correlation, however, shows large scatter. Our objective is to investigate the role that the inclination of the system plays on the correlation between the time lag and the photon index. We find that the correlation between the time lag and the photon index is tight in low-inclination systems and becomes weaker in high-inclination systems. The amplitude of the lags is also larger at low and intermediate inclination angles than at high inclination. Our jet model that reproduces the process of Comptonization in an extended jet can account for the observations remarkably well.\n",

Taking a virial factor of fBLR=1, we find a black hole mass of M∙=9.30+1.26−1.38×106M⊙ from the mean spectra.

    "Changing-look phenomenon observed now in a growing number of active galaxies challenges our understanding of the accretion process close to a black hole. We propose a simple explanation for periodic outbursts in sources operating at a few per cent of the Eddington limit. The mechanism is based on two relatively well understood phenomena: radiation pressure instability and formation of the inner optically thin Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow. The limit cycle behaviour takes place in a relatively narrow transition zone between the standard disk and optically thin flow. Large changes in the cold disk are due to the irradiation by the hot flow with accretion rate strongly varying during the cycle. The model gives quantitative predictions and works well for multiple outbursts of NGC 1566.\n",

    "In response to the comment posted by Nakashima et al. (arXiv:1903.11767), regarding prior claims for the features that we referred to as the Galactic Center Chimneys (2019, Nature, 567, 347), we point out the following: \n",
    "1) The Nakashima et al. 2019 paper appeared in the arXiv on March 8th (1903.02571), after our paper was in the final stage of printing (accepted on January 30th). It is however interesting to see that the morphology of the brightest portions of the two results are in broad agreement (compare their Fig. 1 to our Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). \n",
    "2) Nakashima et al. 2013 ApJ 773, 20 claim the discovery of a blob of recombining plasma ~1deg south of Sgr A*, implying peculiar abundances. Again, their image (Fig. 1) agrees with the brightest portions of our images, although it does not show any direct connection between the plasma blob and the central parsec (e.g., such as the quasi-continuous chimney that we reported), nor evidence for an outflow from the center. We apologize for overlooking an appropriate citation to this contribution by Nakashima et al. \n",
    "3) We fitted the XMM-Newton and Chandra data at the same position of the claimed recombining plasma and we did not find any clear-cut evidence for the presence of either an over-ionised plasma or peculiar abundances. Future X-ray calorimetric observations will presumably clarify this disagreement. \n",
    "4) The continuity of the Chimney features, their quasi-symmetrical placement relative to Sgr A*, and their relatively sharp and well-defined edges are the essential features of our data that have led us to propose that the Chimneys are a unified columnar structure that represents a channel for the outflow of energy from the central region, possibly contributing to the stocking of the relativistic particle population manifested in the Fermi Bubbles.\n",

    "Abstract: We report the discovery of a 1∘ scale X-ray plume in the northern Galactic Center (GC) region observed with Suzaku. The plume is located at (l, b) ∼ (0.∘2, 0.∘6), east of the radio lobe reported by previous studies. No significant X-ray excesses are found inside or to the west of the radio lobe. The spectrum of the plume exhibits strong emiss… ▽ More\n",

    "Recently, Rakshit et al. (2018) reported the discovery of SDSS J103024.95+551622.7, a radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy having a ∼100 kpc scale double-lobed radio structure. Here we analyse archival radio interferometric imaging data taken with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz, and with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 4.3 and 7.6 GHz. Two hotspots and a compact core are detected with the VLA at arcsec scale, while a single milliarcsec-scale compact radio core is seen with the highest resolution VLBA observations. The Fermi Large Area Telescope did not detect γ-ray emission at the position of this source. In the mid-infrared, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite light curve, covering more than 7 years and including the most recent data points, hints on flux density variability at 3.4 μm. Our findings support the notion that this source is a young version of Fanaroff-Riley type II radio galaxies.\n",
