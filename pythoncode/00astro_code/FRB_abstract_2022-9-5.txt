We constrain the Hubble constant H$_0$ using Fast Radio Burst (FRB)
observations from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and
Murriyang (Parkes) radio telescopes. We use the redshift-dispersion measure
(`Macquart') relationship, accounting for the intrinsic luminosity function,
cosmological gas distribution, population evolution, host galaxy contributions
to the dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm host}$), and observational biases due to
burst duration and telescope beamshape. Using an updated sample of 16 ASKAP
FRBs detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) Survey
and localised to their host galaxies, and 60 unlocalised FRBs from Parkes and
ASKAP, our best-fitting value of H$_0$ is calculated to be $73_{-8}^{+12}$ km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Uncertainties in FRB energetics and DM$_{\rm host}$
produce larger uncertainties in the inferred value of H$_0$ compared to
previous FRB-based estimates. Using a prior on H$_0$ covering the 67--74 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ range, we estimate a median DM$_{\rm host} =
186_{-48}^{+59}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, exceeding previous estimates. We
confirm that the FRB population evolves with redshift similarly to the
star-formation rate. We use a Schechter luminosity function to constrain the
maximum FRB energy to be $\log_{10} E_{\rm max}=41.26_{-0.22}^{+0.27}$ erg
assuming a characteristic FRB emission bandwidth of 1 GHz at 1.3 GHz, and the
cumulative luminosity index to be $\gamma=-0.95_{-0.15}^{+0.18}$. We
demonstrate with a sample of 100 mock FRBs that H$_0$ can be measured with an
uncertainty of $\pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, demonstrating the potential
for clarifying the Hubble tension with an upgraded ASKAP FRB search system.
Last, we explore a range of sample and selection biases that affect FRB
analyses.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond-duration radio transients
that appear about 1,000 times per day, all-sky, for a fluence threshold 5 Jy ms
at 600 MHz. The FRB radio-emission physics and the compact objects involved in
these events are subjects of intense active debate. To better constrain source
models, the Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope for Taiwan (BURSTT) is
optimized to discover and localize a large sample of rare, high-fluence, nearby
FRBs. This is the population most amenable to multi-messenger, multi-wavelength
follow-up, allowing deeper understanding of source mechanisms. BURSTT will
provide horizon-to-horizon sky coverage with a half power field-of-view (FoV)
of $\sim$10$^{4}$ deg$^{2}$, a 400 MHz effective bandwidth between 300-800 MHz,
and sub-arcsecond localization, made possible using outrigger stations hundreds
to thousands of km from the main array. Initially, BURSTT will employ 256
antennas. After tests of various antenna designs and optimization of system
performance we plan to expand to 2048 antennas. We estimate that BURSTT-256
will detect and localize $\sim$100 bright ($\geq$100 Jy ms) FRBs per year.
Another advantage of BURSTT's large FoV and continuous operation will be
greatly enhanced monitoring of FRBs for repetition. The current lack of
sensitive all-sky observations likely means that many repeating FRBs are
currently cataloged as single-event FRBs.

We report the detection of FRB20191107B with the UTMOST radio telescope at a
dispersion measure (DM) of 714.9 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. The burst consists of
three components, the brightest of which has an intrinsic width of only 11.3
$\mu$s and a scattering tail with an exponentially decaying time-scale of 21.4
$\mu$s measured at 835 MHz. We model the sensitivity of UTMOST and other major
FRB surveys to such narrow events. We find that $>60\%$ of FRBs like
FRB20191107B are being missed, and that a significant population of very narrow
FRBs probably exists and remains underrepresented in these surveys. The high DM
and small scattering timescale of FRB20191107B allows us to place an upper
limit on the strength of turbulence in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM),
quantified as scattering measure (SM), of ${\rm SM_{IGM} < 8.4 \times 10^{-7}
~kpc~m^{-20/3}}$. Almost all UTMOST FRBs have full phase information due to
real-time voltage capture which provides us with the largest sample of
coherently dedispersed single burst FRBs. Our 10.24 $\mu$s time resolution data
yields accurately measured FRB scattering timescales. We combine the UTMOST
FRBs with 10 FRBs from the literature and find no obvious evidence for a
DM-scattering relation, suggesting that IGM is not the dominant source of
scattering in FRBs. We support the results of previous studies and identify the
local environment of the source in the host galaxy as the most likely region
which dominates the observed scattering of our FRBs.

A fireball of radiation plasma created near the surface of a neutron star
(NS) expands under its own pressure along magnetic field lines, and produces
photon emission and relativistic matter outflow. We comprehensively classify
the expanding fireball evolution into five cases and obtain the photospheric
luminosity and the kinetic energy of the outflow, taking into account key
processes; lateral diffusion of photons escaping from a magnetic flux tube,
effects of strong magnetic field, baryon loading from the NS surface, and
radiative acceleration via cyclotron resonant scattering, some of which have
not been considered in the context of gamma-ray bursts. Applying our model to
magnetar bursts with fast radio bursts (FRBs), in particular the X-ray short
bursts from SGR 1935+2154 associated with the Galactic FRB 20200428A, we show
that the burst radiation can accelerate the outflow to high Lorentz factor with
sufficient energy to power FRBs.

The total available sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been growing
steadily in recent years, facilitating the study of FRBs from a statistical
point of view. At the same time, the classification of FRBs is currently an
imperative issue. We propose that the brightness temperature of bursts can
serve as an ideal criterion for classification. In this work, we gather the
available data for all localized FRBs and we find a positive relation between
the intrinsic pulse width and burst energy, $T_{\rm i}\propto E_\nu^{0.25}$,
for three repeating FRBs that is similar to that of our previous work using FRB
20121102A data alone. The critical line $T_{\rm B,cri}$ is found to vary for
different FRBs, which may reflect the differences in source properties. This
relation can put strong constraints on mainstream radiation mechanisms. It is
evident that neither the coherent curvature radiation or synchrotron maser
radiation have the capability to reach the high brightness temperature required
to reproduce this relation.

We present DM-power, a new method for precisely determining the dispersion
measure (DM) of radio bursts, and apply it to the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) source
FRB 20180916B. Motivated by the complex structure on multiple time scales seen
in FRBs, DM-power optimizes the DM by combining measurements at multiple
Fourier frequencies in the power spectrum of the burst. By optimally weighting
the measurements at each Fourier frequency, DM-power finds a burst DM that
effectively incorporates information on many different burst timescales. We
validate this technique on single pulses from the pulsar B0329+54, and then
apply it to eleven bursts from FRB~20180916B. The precision of these DM
measurements (down to $\sigma_{\rm DM} \sim 0.01~{\rm pc~cm}^{-3}$) are
sufficient to measure a statistically significant variation in DM over a
$\approx 2$~hr span. While this variation could be the result of electron
density variations along the line of sight, it is more like that the observed
variation is the result of intrinsic frequency-dependent burst structure that
can mimic a dispersive delay.

Strong gravitational lensing effect is a powerful tool to probe cosmological
models and gravity theories. Recently, the time-delay cosmography from strong
lensing and the stellar kinematics of the deflector, which encode the Hubble
constant and the post-Newtonian parameter via two distance ratios reflecting
the lensing mass and dynamical mass respectively, have been proposed to
investigate these two parameters simultaneously. Among strong lensing systems
with different sources, strongly lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been
proposed as precision probes of the universe since the time delay $\sim$ 10
days between images could be measured extremely precisely because of their
short duration of a few milliseconds. In this work, we investigate the ability
of strongly lensed FRBs on simultaneously estimating these two parameters via
simulations. Take the expected FRB detection rate of upcoming facilities and
lensing probability into consideration, it is likely to accumulate 10 lensed
FRBs in several years and we find that $H_0$ could be determined to a
$\sim1.5\%$ precision and $\gamma_{\rm PPN}$ could be constrained to a
$\sim8.7\%$ precision simultaneously from them. These simultaneous estimations
will be helpful for properly reflecting the possible correlation between these
two fundamental parameters.

Ultraluminous X-ray bursts (hereafter ULXBs) are ultraluminous X-ray flares
with a fast rise ($\sim$ one minute) and a slow decay ($\sim$ an hour), which
are commonly observed in extragalactic globular clusters. Most ULXBs are
observational one-off bursts, whereas five flares from the same source in NGC
5128 were discovered by Irwin et al. (2016). In this Letter, we propose a
neutron star (NS)-white dwarf (WD) binary model with super-Eddington accretion
rates to explain the repeating behavior of the ULXB source in NGC 5128. With an
eccentric orbit, the mass transfer occurs at the periastron where the WD fills
its Roche lobe. The ultraluminous X-ray flares can be produced by the accretion
column around the NS magnetic poles. On the other hand, some repeating fast
radio bursts (hereafter FRBs) were also found in extragalactic globular
clusters. Repeating ULXBs and repeating FRBs are the most violent bursts in the
X-ray and radio bands, respectively. We propose a possible association between
the repeating ULXBs and the repeating FRBs. Such an association is worth
further investigation by follow-up observations on nearby extragalactic
globular clusters.

Recent observations indicate that magnetars commonly reside in merging
compact binaries and at least part of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sourced by
magnetar activities. It is natural to speculate that a class of merging neutron
star binaries may have FRB emitters. In this work, we study the observational
aspects of these binaries - particularly those with FRB repeaters, which are
promising multi-band and multi-messenger observation targets of radio
telescopes and ground based gravitational wave detectors as the former
telescopes can probe the systems at a much earlier stage in the inspiral than
the latter. We show that observations of FRB repeaters in compact binaries have
a significant advantage in pinning down the binary spin dynamics, constraining
neutron star equation of state, probing FRB production mechanisms, and testing
beyond standard physics. As a proof of principle, we investigate several mock
observations of FRB pulses originating from pre-merger neutron star binaries,
and we find that using the information of FRB arriving times alone, the
intrinsic parameters of this system (including the stellar masses, spins, and
quadrupole moments) can be measured with high precision, and the angular
dependence of the FRB emission pattern can also be well reconstructed. The
measurement of stellar masses (with an error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6}-10^{-5})$)
and quadrupole moments (with an error of $\mathcal{O}(1\%-10\%)$) may be an
unprecedented discriminator of nuclear equations of state in neutron stars. In
addition, we find the multi-band and multi-messenger observations of this
binary will be sensitive to alternative theories of gravity and beyond standard
models, e.g., dynamical Chern-Simons gravity and axion field that is coupled to
matter.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08712v1
Recently, some fast radio burst (FRB) repeaters were reported to exhibit
complex, diverse variations of Faraday rotation measures (RMs), which implies
that they are surrounded by an inhomogeneous, dynamically evolving, magnetized
environment. We systematically investigate some possible astrophysical
processes that may cause RM variations of an FRB repeater. The processes
include (1) a supernova remnant (SNR) with a fluctuating medium; (2) a binary
system with stellar winds from a massive/giant star companion or stellar flares
from a low-mass star companion; (3) a pair plasma medium from a neutron star
(including pulsar winds, pulsar wind nebulae and magnetar flares); (4) outflows
from a massive black hole. For the SNR scenario, a large relative RM variation
during a few years requires that the SNR is young with a thin and local
anisotropic shell, or the size of dens gas clouds in interstellar/circumstellar
medium around the SNR is extremely small. If the RM variation is caused by the
companion medium in a binary system, it is more likely from stellar winds of a
massive/giant star companion. The RM variation contributed by stellar flares
from a low-mass star is disfavored, because this scenario predicts an extremely
large relative RM variation during a short period of time. The scenarios
invoking a pair plasma from a neutron star can be ruled out due to their
extremely low RM contributions. Outflows from a massive black hole could
provide a large RM variation if the FRB source is in the vicinity of the black
hole.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03332v2
We describe how gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is affected
by a plasma screen in the vicinity of the lens or somewhere between the source
and the observer. Wave passage through a turbulent medium affects gravitational
image magnification, lensing probability (particularly for strong magnification
events), and the time delay between images. The magnification is suppressed
because of the broadening of the angular size of the source due to scattering
by the plasma. The time delay between images is modified as the result of
different dispersion measure (DM) along photon trajectories for different
images. Each of the image lightcurve is also broadened due to wave scattering
so that the images could have distinct temporal profiles. The first two effects
are most severe for stellar and sub-stellar mass lens, and the last one
(scatter broadening) for lenses and plasma screens at cosmological distances
from the source/observer. This could limit the use of FRBs to measure their
cosmic abundance. On the other hand, when the time delay between images is
large, such that the lightcurve of a transient source has two or more well
separated peaks, the different DMs along the wave paths of different images can
probe density fluctuations in the IGM on scales $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ rad and
explore the patchy reionization history of the universe using lensed FRBs at
high redshifts. Different rotation measure (RM) along two image paths can
convert linearly polarized radiation from a source to partial circular
polarization.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08208v1
The number of identified Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is increasing rapidly with
current and future facilities. Strongly lensed FRBs are expected to be found as
well, which can provide precise time delays and thus have rich applications in
cosmology and fundamental physics. However, the radio signal of lensed FRBs
will be deflected by plasma in lens galaxies in addition to gravity. Such
deflections by both gravity and plasma will cause frequency dependent time
delays, which are different from the dispersion delay and the geometric delay
caused by gravitational lensing. Depending on the lensing and plasma models,
the frequency-time delay relation of the lensed images can show distinguishing
behaviours either between the multiple images, or from the dispersion relation.
Such phenomena cannot be neglected in future studies, especially at low radio
frequency, as plasma exists in lens galaxies in general. More importantly, such
information provides not only a potential way to search for lensed FRBs, but
also constraints on the mass and plasma distributions in lens galaxy. In
particular, plasma may make the missing central images observable at low radio
frequency.

With the rapid increase of fast radio burst (FRB) detections within the past
few years, there is now a catalogue being developed for all-sky extragalactic
dispersion measure (DM) observations in addition to the existing collection of
all-sky extragalactic Faraday rotation measurements (RMs) of radio galaxies. We
present a method of reconstructing all-sky information of the Galactic magnetic
field component parallel to the line of sight, $B_{\parallel}$, using simulated
observations of the RM and DM along lines of sight to radio galaxies and FRB
populations, respectively. This technique is capable of distinguishing between
different input Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density models.
Significant extragalactic contributions to the DM are the predominant
impediment in accurately reconstructing the Galactic DM and
$\left<B_{\parallel}\right>$ skies. We look at ways to improve the
reconstruction by applying a filtering algorithm on the simulated DM lines of
sight and we derive generalized corrections for DM observations at $|b|$ > 10
deg that help to disentangle Galactic and extragalactic DM contributions.
Overall, we are able to reconstruct both large-scale Galactic structure and
local features in the Milky Way's magnetic field from the assumed models. We
discuss the application of this technique to future FRB observations and
address possible differences between our simulated model and observed data,
namely: adjusting the priors of the inference model, an unevenly distributed
population of FRBs on the sky, and localized extragalactic DM structures.

We develop a model of the generation of coherent radio emission in the Crab
pulsar, magnetars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Emission is produced by a
reconnection-generated beam of particles via a variant of Free Electron Laser
(FEL) mechanism, operating in a weakly-turbulent, guide-field dominated plasma.
We first consider nonlinear Thomson scattering in a guide-field dominated
regime, and apply to model to explain emission bands observed in Crab pulsar
and in Fast Radio Bursts. We consider particle motion in a combined fields of
the electromagnetic wave and thee lectromagnetic (Alfvenic) wiggler. Charge
bunches, created via a ponderomotive force, Compton/Raman scatter the wiggler
field coherently. The model is both robust to the underlying plasma parameters
and succeeds in reproducing a number of subtle observed features: (i) emission
frequencies depend mostly on the length $\lambda_t$ of turbulence and the
Lorentz factor of the reconnection generated beam, $\omega \sim \gamma_b^2 (
c/\lambda_t) $ - it is independent of the absolute value of the underlying
magnetic field. (ii) The model explains both broadband emission and the
presence of emission stripes, including multiple stripes observed in the High
Frequency Interpulse of the Crab pulsar. (iii) The model reproduces correlated
polarization properties: presence of narrow emission bands in the spectrum
favors linear polarization, while broadband emission can have arbitrary
polarization. (iv) The mechanism is robust to the momentum spread of the
particle in the beam. We also discuss a model of wigglers as non-linear
force-free Alfven solitons (light darts).

Periodicities observed in two Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources (16 days in FRB
180916.J0158+65 and 160 days in FRB 121102) are consistent with that of tight,
stellar mass binary systems. In the case of FRB 180916.J0158+65 the primary is
an early OB-type star with mass loss rate $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8}- 10^{-7}
M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and the secondary a neutron star. The observed periodicity
is not intrinsic to the FRB's source, but is due to the orbital phase-dependent
modulation of the absorption conditions in the massive star's wind. The
observed relatively narrow FRB activity window implies that the primary's wind
dynamically dominates that of the pulsar, $\eta = L_{sd}/(\dot{M} v_w c) \leq
1$, where $L_{sd} $ is pulsar spin-down, $\dot{M}$ is the primary's wind mass
loss rate and $v_w$ is its velocity. The condition $\eta \leq 1$ requires
mildly powerful pulsar with $L_{sd} \lesssim 10^{37}$ erg $s^{-1}$. The
observations are consistent with magnetically-powered radio emission
originating in the magnetospheres of strongly magnetized neutron stars, the
classical magnetars.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10409v3
We build a model of radius-to-frequency mapping in magnetospheres of neutron
stars and apply it to frequency drifts observed in Fast Radio Bursts. We assume
that an emission patch propagates along the dipolar magnetic field lines
producing coherent emission with frequency, direction and polarization defined
by the local magnetic field. The observed temporal evolution of the frequency
depends on relativistic effects of time contraction and the curvature of the
magnetic field lines. The model generically produces linear scaling of the
drift rate, $\dot{\omega} \propto - \omega$, matching both numerically and
parametrically the rates observed in FBRs; a more complicated behavior of
$\dot{\omega} $ is also possible. Fast rotating magnetospheres produce higher
drifts rates for similar viewing parameters than the slowly rotating ones. In
the case of repeaters same source may show variable drift pattens depending on
the observing phase. We expect rotational of polarization position angle
through a burst, though by smaller amount than in radio pulsars. All these
findings compare favorably with properties of FBRs, strengthening their
possible loci in the magnetospheres of neutron stars.

The study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is of great importance, and is a topic
that has been extensively researched, particularly in recent years. While the
extreme nature of FRBs can serve as a tool for researchers to probe the
intergalactic medium and study exotic aspects of the Universe, the rapid
discovery of FRBs has recently deemed the track of new events challenging.
FRBSTATS provides a user-friendly web interface to an open-access catalogue of
FRBs published up to date, along with a statistical overview of the observed
events. The platform supports the retrieval of fundamental FRB data either
directly through the FRBSTATS API, or in the form of a CSV/JSON-parsed
database, while enabling the plotting of parameters and their distributions,
for a variety of visualizations. These features allow researchers to conduct
population studies and comparisons with astrophysical models, describing the
origin and emission mechanism behind these sources. So far, the redshift
estimates of 806 bursts have been computed and derived, providing the first
public database that includes redshift entries for nearly all observed FRBs.
Lastly, the platform provides a visualization tool that illustrates
associations between primary bursts and repeaters, complementing basic repeater
information provided by the Transient Name Server. In this work, we present the
structure of the platform, the established version control system, as well as
the strategy for maintaining such an open database up to date. Additionally, we
introduce a novel, computationally-efficient, clustering-based approach that
enables unsupervised classification of hundreds of bursts into repeaters and
non-repeaters, resulting in the discovery of three new FRB repeaters.

Repeating and apparently non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts are distinct classes
of events produced by distinct classes of sources. As for conference
proceedings, this paper reviews the evidence for that division, and then
discusses the statistics of and possible models of each class of source: black
hole accretion discs for repeating FRB and hypermagnetized neutron stars (SGR)
for apparently non-repeating FRB.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a class of highly energetic, mostly
extragalactic radio transients lasting for a few milliseconds. While over 600
FRBs have been published so far, their origins are presently unclear, with some
theories for extragalactic FRBs predicting accompanying high-energy emission.
In this work, we use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project to explore whether any FRB-like radio
emission coincides in space and time with 81 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected
between 2018 July 17 and 2019 July 8 by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We do not find
any statistically significant, coincident pairs within 3sigma of each other's
spatial localization regions and within a time difference of up to one week. In
addition to searching for spatial matches between known FRBs and known GRBs, we
use CHIME/FRB to constrain FRB-like radio emission before, at the time of, or
after the reported high-energy emission at the position of 39 GRBs. Our most
constraining radio flux limits in the 400- to 800-MHz band for short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs) are <50 Jy at 18.6 ks pre-high-energy emission, and <5 Jy at
28.4 ks post-high-energy emission, assuming a 10-ms radio burst width with each
limit valid for 60 seconds. We use these limits to constrain models that
predict FRB-like prompt radio emission before and after SGRBs. We also place
limits as low as 2 Jy for long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), but there are no
strong theoretical predictions for coincident FRB-like radio emission for
LGRBs.

We conduct 24.4~fps optical observations of repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB)
20190520B using Tomo-e Gozen, a high-speed CMOS camera mounted on the Kiso
105-cm Schmidt telescope, simultaneously with radio observations carried out
using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We
succeeded in the simultaneous optical observations of 11 radio bursts that FAST
detected. However, no corresponding optical emission was found. The optical
fluence limits as deep as 0.068 Jy ms are obtained for the individual bursts
(0.029 Jy ms on the stacked data) corrected for the dust extinction in the
Milky Way. The fluence limit is deeper than those obtained in the previous
simultaneous observations for an optical emission with a duration $\gtrsim 0.1$
ms. Although the current limits on radio--optical spectral energy distribution
(SED) of FRBs are not constraining, we show that SED models based on observed
SEDs of radio variable objects such as optically detected pulsars, and a part
of parameter spaces of theoretical models in which FRB optical emission is
produced by inverse-Compton scattering in a pulsar magnetosphere or a strike of
a magnetar blastwave into a hot wind bubble, can be ruled out once a similar
fluence limit as in our observation is obtained for a bright FRB with a radio
fluence $\gtrsim 5$ Jy ms.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14316v1
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, energetic, extragalactic flashes of radio
emission whose progenitors are largely unknown. Although studying the FRB
population is essential for understanding how these astrophysical phenomena
occur, such studies have been difficult to conduct without large numbers of
FRBs and characterizable observational biases. Using the recently released
catalog of 536 FRBs published by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment/Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) collaboration, we present a study of
the FRB population that also calibrates for selection effects. Assuming a
Schechter luminosity function, we infer a characteristic energy cut-off of
$E_\mathrm{char} =$ $2.38^{+5.35}_{-1.64} \times 10^{41}$ erg and a
differential power-law index of $\gamma =$ $-1.3^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$.
Simultaneously, we infer a volumetric rate of
[$7.3^{+8.8}_{-3.8}$(stat.)$^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$(sys.)]$\times 10^4$ bursts
Gpc$^{-3}$ year$^{-1}$ above a pivot energy of 10$^{39}$ erg and below a
scattering timescale of 10 ms at 600 MHz, and find we cannot significantly
constrain the cosmic evolution of the FRB population with star formation rate.
Modeling the host dispersion measure (DM) contribution as a log-normal
distribution and assuming a total Galactic contribution of 80 pc cm$^{-3}$, we
find a median value of $\mathrm{DM}_\mathrm{host} =$ $84^{+69}_{-49}$ pc
cm$^{-3}$, comparable with values typically used in the literature. Proposed
models for FRB progenitors should be consistent with the energetics and
abundances of the full FRB population predicted by our results. Finally, we
infer the redshift distribution of FRBs detected with CHIME, which will be
tested with the localizations and redshifts enabled by the upcoming CHIME/FRB
Outriggers project.

FRB 20180916B is a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) with an activity period
of 16.33 days. In previous observations ranging from $\sim 150-1400$ MHz, the
activity window was found to be frequency dependent, with lower frequency
bursts occurring later. In this work, we present the highest-frequency
detections of bursts from this FRB, using the 100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope
at 4$-$8 GHz. We present the results from two observing campaigns. We performed
the first campaign over an entire activity period which resulted in no
detections. The second campaign was in an active window at 4$-$8 GHz which we
predicted from our modelling of chromaticity, resulting in eight burst
detections. The bursts were detected in a window of 1.35 days, 3.6 days
preceding the activity peak seen by CHIME, suggesting the chromaticity extends
to higher frequency. The detected bursts have narrower temporal widths and
larger spectral widths compared to lower frequencies. All of them have flat
polarization position angle sweeps and high polarization fractions. The bursts
also exhibit diffractive scintillation due to the Milky Way, following a
$f^{3.90\pm0.05}$ scaling, and vary significantly over time. We find that burst
rate across frequency scales as $f^{-2.6\pm0.2}$. Lastly, we examine
implications of the frequency dependency on the source models.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12332v1
We present four new fast radio bursts discovered in a search of the Parkes
70-cm pulsar survey data archive for dispersed single pulses and bursts. We
searched dispersion measures (DMs) ranging between 0 to 5000 pc cm$^{-3}$ with
the HEIMDALL and FETCH detection and classification algorithms. All four of the
FRBs discovered have significantly larger widths ($> 50$ ms) than almost all of
the FRBs detected and cataloged to date. The large pulse widths are not
dominated by interstellar scattering or dispersive smearing within channels.
One of the FRBs has a DM of 3338 pc cm$^{3}$, the largest measured for any FRB
to date. These are also the first FRBs detected by any radio telescope so far,
predating the Lorimer Burst by almost a decade. Our results suggest that pulsar
survey archives remain important sources of previously undetected FRBs and that
searches for FRBs on time scales extending beyond $\sim 100$ ms may reveal the
presence of a larger population of wide-pulse FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09696v1
We check if the first significant digit of the dispersion measure of pulsars
and Fast Radio Bursts (using the CHIME catalog) is consistent with the Benford
distribution. We find a large disagreement with Benford's law with $\chi^2$
close to 80 for 8 degrees of freedom for both these aforementioned datasets.
This corresponds to a discrepancy of about 7$\sigma$. Therefore, we conclude
that the dispersion measures of pulsars and FRBs do not obey Benford's law.

Recent CHIME/FRB observations of the periodic repeating FRB 180916B have
produced a homogeneous sample of 44 bursts. These permit a redetermination of
the modulation period and phase window, in agreement with earlier results. If
the periodicity results from the precession of an accretion disc, in analogy
with those of Her X-1, SS 433, and many other superorbital periods, the width
of the observable phase window indicates that the disc axis jitters by an angle
of about 0.14 of the inclination angle, similar to the ratio of 0.14 in the
well-observed jittering jet source SS 433.

FRB 20121102A is the first known fast radio burst (FRB) from which repeat
bursts were detected, and one of the best-studied FRB sources in the
literature. Here we report on the analysis of 478 bursts (333 previously
unreported) from FRB 20121102A using the 305-m Arecibo telescope - detected
during approximately 59 hours of observations between December 2015 and October
2016. The majority of bursts are from a burst storm around September 2016. This
is the earliest available sample of a large number of FRB 20121102A bursts, and
it thus provides an anchor point for long-term studies of the source's evolving
properties. We observe that the bursts separate into two groups in the
width-bandwidth-energy parameter space, which we refer to as the low-energy
bursts (LEBs) and high-energy bursts (HEBs). The LEBs are typically longer
duration and narrower bandwidth than the HEBs, reminiscent of the
spectro-temporal differences observed between the bursts of repeating and
non-repeating FRBs. We fit the cumulative burst rate-energy distribution with a
broken power-law and find that it flattens out toward higher energies. The
sample shows a diverse zoo of burst morphologies. Notably, burst emission seems
to be more common at the top than the bottom of our 1150 - 1730 MHz observing
band. We also observe that bursts from the same day appear to be more similar
to each other than to those of other days, but this observation requires
confirmation. The wait times and burst rates that we measure are consistent
with previous studies. We discuss these results, primarily in the context of
magnetar models.

Advanced LIGO and Virgo have reported ninety confident gravitational-wave
(GW) observations from compact-binary coalescences from their three observation
runs. In addition, numerous subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates have
been identified. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can produce gravitational
waves and short-gamma ray bursts, as confirmed by GW170817/GRB 170817A. There
may be electromagnetic counterparts recorded in archival observations
associated with subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates. The CHIME/FRB
collaboration has reported the first large sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs),
millisecond radio transients detected up to cosmological distances; a fraction
of these may be associated with BNS mergers. This work searches for coincident
gravitational waves and FRBs from BNS mergers using candidates from the
4th-Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (4-OGC) and the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We
use a ranking statistic for GW/FRB association which combines the
gravitational-wave detection statistic with the odds of temporal and spatial
association. We analyze gravitational-wave candidates and non-repeating FRBs
from 2019 April 1 to 2019 July 1, when both the Advanced LIGO/Virgo
gravitational-wave detectors and the CHIME radio telescope were observing. The
most significant coincident candidate has a false alarm rate of 0.29 per
observation time, which is consistent with a null observation. The null results
imply at most $\mathcal{O}(0.01)\%$ - $\mathcal{O}(1)\%$ of FRBs are produced
from the BNS mergers.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration flashes of radio waves that
are visible at distances of billions of light-years. The nature of their
progenitors and their emission mechanism remain open astrophysical questions.
Here we report the detection of the multi-component FRB 20191221A and the
identification of a periodic separation of 216.8(1) ms between its components
with a significance of 6.5 sigmas. The long (~3 s) duration and nine or more
components forming the pulse profile make this source an outlier in the FRB
population. Such short periodicity provides strong evidence for a neutron-star
origin of the event. Moreover, our detection favours emission arising from the
neutron-star magnetosphere, as opposed to emission regions located further away
from the star, as predicted by some models.

Where the cosmic baryons lie in and around galactic dark matter halos is only
weakly constrained. We develop a method to quickly paint on models for their
distribution. Our approach uses the statistical advantages of $N$-body
simulations, while painting on the profile of gas around individual halos in
ways that can be motivated by semi-analytic models or zoom-in hydrodynamic
simulations of galaxies. Possible applications of the algorithm include
extragalactic dispersion measures to fast radio bursts (FRBs), the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, baryonic effects on weak lensing, and cosmic metal
enrichment. As an initial application, we use this tool to investigate how the
baryonic profile of foreground galactic-mass halos affects the statistics of
the dispersion measure (DM) towards cosmological FRBs.
  We show that the distribution of DM is sensitive to the distribution of
baryons in galactic halos, with viable gas profile models having significantly
different probability distributions for DM to a given redshift. We also
investigate the requirements to statistically measure the circumgalactic
electron profile for FRB analyses that stack DM with impact parameter to
foreground galaxies, quantifying the size of the contaminating "two-halo" term
from correlated systems and the number of FRBs for a high significance
detection. Publicly available Python modules implement our CGMBrush algorithm.

At least some fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by magnetars. Even though
mounting observational evidence points towards a magnetospheric origin of FRB
emission, the question of the location for FRB generation continues to be
debated. One argument suggested against the magnetospheric origin of bright
FRBs is that the radio waves associated with an FRB may lose most of their
energy before escaping the magnetosphere because the cross-section for $e^\pm$
to scatter large-amplitude EM waves in the presence of a strong magnetic field
is much larger than the Thompson cross-section. We have investigated this
suggestion and find that FRB radiation traveling through the open field line
region of a magnetar's magnetosphere does not suffer much loss due to two
previously ignored factors. First, the plasma in the outer magnetosphere ($r
\gta 10^9 \ $cm), where the losses are potentially most severe, is likely to be
flowing outward at a high Lorentz factor $\gamma_p \geq 10^3$. Second, the
angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field vector, $\theta_B$, in the
outer magnetosphere is likely of the order of 0.1 radian or smaller due in part
to the intense FRB pulse that tilts open magnetic field lines so that they get
aligned with the pulse propagation direction. Both these effects reduce the
interaction between the FRB pulse and the plasma substantially. We find that a
bright FRB with an isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm frb} \gta 10^{42} \ {\rm erg \
s^{-1}}$ can escape the magnetosphere unscathed for a large section of the
$\gamma_p-\theta_B$ parameter space, and therefore conclude that the generation
of FRBs in magnetar magnetosphere passes this test.

Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been an active field in astronomy and
cosmology, their origin is still unknown to date. One of the interesting topics
is the classification of FRBs, which is closely related to the origin of FRBs.
Different physical mechanisms are required by different classes of FRBs. In the
literature, they usually could be classified into non-repeating and repeating
FRBs. Well motivated by the observations, here we are interested in the
possible subclassification of FRBs. By using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we
propose to subclassify non-repeating (type I) FRBs into type Ia and Ib FRBs.
The distribution of type Ia FRBs is delayed with respect to the cosmic star
formation history (SFH), and hence they are probably associated with old
stellar populations, while the distribution of type Ib FRBs tracks SFH, and
hence they are probably associated with young stellar populations. Accordingly,
the physical criteria for this subclassification of type I FRBs have been
clearly determined. We find that there are some tight empirical correlations
for type Ia FRBs but not for type Ib FRBs, and vice versa. These make them
different in physical properties. Similarly, we suggest that repeating (type
II) FRBs could also be subclassified into type IIa and IIb FRBs. A universal
subclassification scheme is given at the end. This subclassification of FRBs
might help us to reveal quite different physical mechanisms behind them, and
improve their applications in astronomy and cosmology.

We propose a Bregman inertial forward-reflected-backward (BiFRB) method for
nonconvex composite problems. Our analysis relies on a novel approach that
imposes general conditions on implicit merit function parameters, which yields
a stepsize condition that is independent of inertial parameters. In turn, a
question of Malitsky and Tam regarding whether FRB can be equipped with a
Nesterov-type acceleration is resolved. Assuming the generalized concave
Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property of a quadratic regularization of the objective,
we obtain sequential convergence of BiFRB, as well as convergence rates on both
the function value and actual sequence. We also present formulae for the
Bregman subproblem, supplementing not only BiFRB but also the work of
Bo\c{t}-Csetnek-L\'aszl\'o and Bo\c{t}-Csetnek. Numerical simulations are
conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm.

Tight limits on the photon mass have been set through analyzing the arrival
time differences of photons with different frequencies originating from the
same astrophysical source. However, all these constraints have relied on using
the first-order Taylor expansion of the dispersion due to a nonzero photon
mass. In this work, we present an analysis of the nonzero photon mass
dispersion with the second-order derivative of Taylor series. If the arrival
time delay corrected for all known effects (including the first-order delay
time due to the plasma and photon mass effects) is assumed to be dominated by
the second-order term of the nonzero photon mass dispersion, a conservative
upper limit on the photon mass can be estimated. Here we show that the
dedispersed pulses with the second-order time delays from the Crab pulsar and
the fast radio burst FRB 180916B pose strict limits on the photon mass, i.e.,
$m_{\gamma,2} \leq5.7\times10^{-46}\;{\rm kg}\simeq3.2\times10^{-10}\; {\rm
eV}/c^{2}$ and $m_{\gamma,2} \leq5.1\times10^{-47}\;{\rm
kg}\simeq2.9\times10^{-11}\; {\rm eV}/c^{2}$, respectively. This is the first
time to study the possible second-order photon mass effect.

We present radio continuum observations of NGC 2082 using ASKAP, ATCA and
Parkes telescopes from 888 MHz to 9000 MHz. Some 20 arcsec from the centre of
this nearby spiral galaxy, we discovered a bright and compact radio source,
J054149.24-641813.7, of unknown origin. To constrain the nature of
J054149.24-641813.7, we searched for transient events with the Ultra-Wideband
Low Parkes receiver, and compare its luminosity and spectral index to various
nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), and fast radio burst (FRB) local
environments. Its radio spectral index is flat (${\alpha} = 0.02 \pm 0.09$)
which is unlikely to be either an SNR or pulsar. No transient events were
detected with the Parkes telescope over three days of observations, and our
calculations show J054149.24-641813.7 is two orders of magnitude less luminous
than the persistent radio sources associated with FRB 121102 & 190520B. We find
that the probability of finding such a source behind NGC 2082 is P = 1.2%, and
conclude that the most likely origin for J054149.24-641813.7 is a background
quasar or radio galaxy.

Roche lobe overflow from a donor star onto a black hole or neutron star
binary companion can evolve to a phase of unstable runaway mass-transfer,
lasting as short as hundreds of orbits ($\lesssim 10^{2}$ yr for a giant
donor), and eventually culminating in a common envelope event. The highly
super-Eddington accretion rates achieved during this brief phase ($\dot{M}
\gtrsim 10^{5}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd})$ are accompanied by intense mass-loss in disk
winds, analogous but even more extreme than ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) sources
in the nearby universe. Also in analogy with observed ULX, this expanding
outflow will inflate an energetic `bubble' of plasma into the circumbinary
medium. Embedded within this bubble is a nebula of relativistic electrons
heated at the termination shock of the faster $v \gtrsim 0.1 c$ wind/jet from
the inner accretion flow. We present a time-dependent, one-zone model for the
synchrotron radio emission and other observable properties of such ULX
`hyper-nebulae'. If ULX jets are sources of repeating fast radio bursts (FRB),
as recently proposed, such hyper-nebulae could generate persistent radio
emission and contribute large and time-variable rotation measure to the bursts,
consistent with those seen from FRB 20121102 and FRB 190520B. ULX hyper-nebulae
can be discovered independent of an FRB association in radio surveys such as
VLASS, as off-nuclear point-sources whose fluxes can evolve significantly on
timescales as short as years, possibly presaging energetic transients from
common envelope mergers.

Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs) offers an exciting avenue
for several cosmological applications. However, it is not yet clear how many
such events future surveys will detect nor how to optimally find them. We use
the known properties of FRBs to forecast detection rates of gravitational
lensing on delay timescales from microseconds to years, corresponding to lens
masses spanning fifteen orders of magnitude. We highlight the role of the FRB
redshift distribution on our ability to observe gravitational lensing. We
consider cosmological lensing of FRBs by stars in foreground galaxies and show
that strong stellar lensing will dominate on microsecond timescales. Upcoming
surveys such as DSA-2000 and CHORD will constrain the fraction of dark matter
in compact objects (e.g. primordial black holes) and may detect millilensing
events from intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or small dark matter halos.
Coherent all-sky monitors will be able to detect longer-duration lensing events
from massive galaxies, in addition to short time-scale lensing. Finally, we
propose a new application of FRB gravitational lensing that will measure
directly the circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies.

Dedicated surveys searching for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are subject to
selection effects which bias the observed population of events. Software
injection systems are one method of correcting for these biases by injecting a
mock population of synthetic FRBs directly into the realtime search pipeline.
The injected population may then be used to map intrinsic burst properties onto
an expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), so long as telescope characteristics
such as the beam model and calibration factors are properly accounted for. This
paper presents an injection system developed for the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst project (CHIME/FRB). The system
was tested to ensure high detection efficiency, and the pulse calibration
method was verified. Using an injection population of ~85,000 synthetic FRBs,
we found that the correlation between fluence and SNR for injected FRBs was
consistent with that of CHIME/FRB detections in the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We
also noted that the sensitivity of the telescope varied strongly as a function
of the broadened burst width, but not as a function of the dispersion measure.
We conclude that some of the machine-learning based Radio Frequency
Interference (RFI) mitigation methods used by CHIME/FRB can be re-trained using
injection data to increase sensitivity to wide events, and that planned
upgrades to the presented injection system will allow for determining a more
accurate CHIME/FRB selection function in the near future.

In this paper, we present a sample of 21 repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs)
detected by different radio instruments before September 2021. Using the
Anderson--Darling test, we compared the distributions of extra-Galactic
dispersion measure ($DM_{\rm E}$) of non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs and all
FRBs. It was found that the $ DM_{\rm E}$ values of three sub-samples are
log-normally distributed. The $DM_{\rm E}$ of repeaters and non-repeaters were
drawn from a different distribution on basis of the Mann--Whitney--Wilcoxon
test. In addition, assuming that the non-repeating FRBs identified currently
may be potentially repeators, i.e., the repeating FRBs to be universal and
representative, one can utilize the averaged fluence of repeating FRBs as an
indication from which to derive an apparent intensity distribution function
(IDF) with a power-law index of $a_1=$ $1.10\pm 0.14$ ($a_2=$ $1.01\pm 0.16$,
the observed fluence as a statistical variant), which is in good agreement with
the previous IDF of 16 non-repeating FRBs found by Li et al. Based on the above
statistics of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, we propose that both types of
FRBs may have different cosmological origins, spatial distributions and
circum-burst environments. Interestingly, the differential luminosity
distributions of repeating and non-repeating FRBs can also be well described by
a broken power-law function with the same power-law index of $-$1.4.

Correlated red noise recently reported from pulsar timing observations may be
an indication of stochastic gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings that
formed during a primordial phase transition near the Grand Unification energy
scale. Unfortunately, known probes of cosmic strings, namely the Cosmic
Microwave Background anisotropies and string lensing of extragalactic galaxies,
are not sensitive enough for low string tensions of $G\mu = 10^{-10}-10^{-7}$
that are needed to explain this putative signal. We show that strong
gravitational lensing of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) by cosmic strings is a
potentially unambiguous avenue to probe that range of string tension values.
The image pair of string lensing are expected to have identical magnification
factor and parity, and have a typical time delay of $\sim
10^2\,\,(G\,\mu/10^{-8})^2$ seconds. The unique spectral fingerprint of each
FRB, as well as the possibility to detect correlations in the time series of
the electric field of the radio waves, will enable verification of the string
lensing interpretation. Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations
can spatially resolve the image pair and provide a lower bound on the string
tension based on the image separation. We calculate the FRB lensing rate as a
function of FRB detection number for several different models of the FRB
redshift distribution. We find that a survey detecting $\sim 10^5$ FRBs, in
line with estimates for the detection rate of the forthcoming survey CHORD, can
uncover a strong lensing event for a string tension of $G\mu \simeq 10^{-7}$.
Larger FRB surveys, such as Phase 2 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), have
the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity on the string tension to
$G\mu \simeq 10^{-9}$.

We report the discovery and follow-up observations of VT 1137-0337: an
unusual radio transient found in our systematic search for extragalactic
explosions in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS). VT 1137-0337 is located in the
brightest region of a dwarf starburst galaxy (stellar mass $\sim 10^{8.3}
M_{\odot}$, star formation rate $\sim 0.5 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) at a luminosity
distance of 121.6 Mpc. Its 3 GHz luminosity of $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{28}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ is comparable to luminous radio supernovae associated with
dense circumstellar interaction and relativistic outflows. However, its
broadband radio spectrum - a featureless power law $\propto \nu^{-0.35 \pm
0.02}$ over a range of $\gtrsim$10$\times$ in frequency and fading at a rate of
$\sim$ 5% per year over 4 years - cannot be directly explained by the shock of
a stellar explosion. Jets launched by various classes of accreting black holes
also struggle to account for VT 1137-0337's combination of observational
properties. Instead, we propose that VT 1137-0337 is a $\sim$decades old pulsar
wind nebula that has recently emerged from within the free-free opacity of its
surrounding supernova ejecta. If the nebula is powered by spindown, the central
neutron star should be highly magnetized, with a surface dipole field of $\sim
10^{13} - 10^{14}$ G and a present-day spin period of $\sim 10 - 100$ ms.
Alternatively, the nebula may be powered by the release of magnetic energy from
a magnetar. Magnetar nebulae have been proposed to explain the persistent radio
sources associated with the repeating fast radio bursts FRB 121102 and FRB
190520B. These FRB persistent sources have not previously been observed as
transients, but do bear a striking resemblance to VT 1137-0337 in their radio
luminosity, spectral index, and host galaxy properties.

A correlation between the intrinsic energy and the burst duration of
non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been reported. If it exists, the
correlation can be used to estimate intrinsic energy from the duration, and
thus can provide us with a new distance measure for cosmology. However, the
correlation suffered from small number statistics (68 FRBs) and was not free
from contamination by latent repeating populations, which might not have such a
correlation. How to separate/exclude the repeating bursts from the mixture of
all different types of FRBs is essential to see this property. Using a much
larger sample from the new FRB catalogue (containing 536 FRBs) recently
released by the CHIME/FRB project, combined with a new classification method
developed based on unsupervised machine learning, we carried out further
scrutiny of the relation. We found that there is a weak correlation between the
intrinsic energy and duration for non-repeating FRBs at z < 0.3 with Kendall's
tau correlation coefficient of 0.239 and significance of 0.001 (statistically
significant), whose slope looks similar to that of gamma-ray bursts. This
correlation becomes weaker and insignificant at higher redshifts (z > 0.3),
possibly due to the lack of the faint FRBs at high-z and/or the redshift
evolution of the correlation. The scattering time in the CHIME/FRB catalogue
shows an intriguing trend: it varies along the line obtained from linear fit on
the energy versus duration plane between these two parameters. A possible
cosmological application of the relation must wait for faint FRBs at high-z.

We present a multiband study of FRB 20180916B, a repeating source with a 16.3
day periodicity. We report the detection of 4, 1 and 7 bursts from observations
spanning 3 days using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (300-500 MHz),
Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (400-800 MHz) and Green Bank
Telescope (600-1000 MHz), respectively. We report the first-ever detection of
the source in the 800-1000 MHz range along with one of the widest instantaneous
bandwidth detection (200 MHz) at lower frequencies. We identify 30 $\mu$s wide
structures in one of the bursts at 800 MHz, making it the lowest frequency
detection of such structures for this FRB thus far. There is also a clear
indication of high activity of the source at a higher frequency during earlier
phases of the activity cycle. We identify a gradual decrease in the rotation
measure over two years and no significant variations in the dispersion measure.
We derive useful conclusions about progenitor scenarios, energy distribution,
emission mechanisms, and variation of downward drift rate of emission with
frequency. Our results reinforce that multiband observations are an effective
approach to study repeaters and even one-off events to better understand their
varying activity and spectral anomalies.

One scenario for the generation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is magnetic
reconnection in a current sheet of the magnetar wind. Compressed by a strong
magnetic pulse induced by a magnetar flare, the current sheet fragments into a
self-similar chain of magnetic islands. Time-dependent plasma currents at their
interfaces produce coherent radiation during their hierarchical coalescence. We
investigate this scenario using 2D radiative relativistic particle-in-cell
simulations to compute the efficiency of the coherent emission and to obtain
frequency scalings. Consistent with expectations, a fraction of the reconnected
magnetic field energy, $f\sim 0.002$, is converted to packets of high-frequency
fast magnetosonic waves which can escape from the magnetar wind as radio
emission. In agreement with analytical estimates, we find that magnetic pulses
of $10^{47}\text{erg}\;\text{s}^{-1}$ can trigger relatively narrowband GHz
emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{42}\text{erg}\;\text{s}^{-1}$,
sufficient to explain bright extragalactic FRBs. The mechanism provides a
natural explanation for a downward frequency drift of burst signals, as well as
the $\sim 100\;\text{ns}$ substructure recently detected in FRB 20200120E.

Extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a new class of astrophysical
transients with unknown origins that have become a main focus of radio
observatories worldwide. FRBs are highly energetic ($\sim 10^{36}$-$10^{42}$
ergs) flashes that last for about a millisecond. Thanks to its broad bandwidth
(400-800 MHz), large field of view ($\sim$200 sq. deg.), and massive data rate
(1500 TB of coherently beamformed data per day), the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment / Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project has
increased the total number of discovered FRBs by over a factor 10 in 3 years of
operation. CHIME/FRB observations are hampered by the constant exposure to
radio frequency interference (RFI) from artificial devices (e.g., cellular
phones, aircraft), resulting in $\sim$20% loss of bandwidth. In this work, we
describe our novel technique for mitigating RFI in CHIME/FRB real-time
intensity data. We mitigate RFI through a sequence of iterative operations,
which mask out statistical outliers from frequency-channelized intensity data
that have been effectively high-pass filtered. Keeping false positive and false
negative rates at very low levels, our approach is useful for any
high-performance surveys of radio transients in the future.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extremely luminous and brief signals (with
duration of milliseconds or even shorter) of extragalactic origin. Despite the
fact that hundreds of FRBs have been discovered to date, their nature still
remains unclear. Precise localizations of FRBs can unveil their host galaxies
and local environments -- and thus shed light on the physical processes that
led to the burst production. However, this has only been achieved for a few
FRBs to date. The European VLBI Network (EVN) is currently the only instrument
capable of localizing FRBs down to the milliarcsecond level. This level of
precision was critical to associate the first localized FRB, 20121102A, to a
star-forming region in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy and physically related it
to a compact persistent radio source. Analogously, a second repeating FRB,
20180916B, was found to just outside the edge of a prominent star-forming
region of a nearby spiral galaxy. The PRECISE project (Pinpointing REpeating
ChIme Sources with EVN dishes), starting from 2019, has observed hundreds of
hours per year with a subset of EVN telescopes with the goal of localizing
repeating FRBs discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. The ultimate goal of
PRECISE is to disentangling the environments where FRBs can be produced. Here
we present the state of the art of the FRB field, the PRECISE project, and the
localizations achieved until now, which have unveiled a variety of environments
where FRBs can be found that challenges the current models.

Through the relationship between dispersion measures (DM) and redshifts, fast
radio bursts (FRBs) are considered to be very promising cosmological probes. In
this paper, we attempted to use the DM-z relationship of FRBs to study the
helium abundance ($Y_{\rm He}$) in the universe. First, we used 17 current FRBs
with known redshifts for our study. Due to their low redshifts and the strong
degeneracy between $Y_{\rm He}$ and $\Omega_bh^2$, however, this catalog could
not provide a good constraint on the helium abundance. Then, we simulated 500
low redshift FRB mock data with $z\in[0,\,1.5]$ to forecast the constraining
ability on $Y_{\rm He}$. In order to break the degeneracy between $Y_{\rm He}$
and $\Omega_bh^2$ further, we introduced the shift parameters of the Planck
measurement $(R,l_A,\Omega_bh^2)$ as a prior, where $\Omega_bh^2$ represents
the baryon density parameter, and $R$ and $l_A$ correspond to the scaled
distance to recombination and the angular scale of the sound horizon at
recombination, respectively. We obtained the standard deviation for the helium
abundance: $\sigma({Y_{\rm He}}) = 0.025$. Finally, we considered 2000 higher
redshift FRB data with the redshift distribution of $[0,\,3]$ and found that
the constraining power for $Y_{\rm He}$ would be improved by more than 2 times,
$\sigma({Y_{\rm He}}) = 0.011$, which indicates that the FRB data with high
redshift can provide a better constraint on the helium abundance. Hopefully,
large FRB samples with high redshift from the Square Kilometre Array can
provide high-precision measurements of the helium abundance in the near future.

We consider propagation of polarization in the inner parts of pair-symmetric
magnetar winds, close to the light cylinder. Pair plasmas in magnetic field is
birefringent, a $\propto B^2$ effect. As a result, such plasmas work as phase
retarders: Stokes parameters follow a circular trajectory on the Poincare
sphere. In the highly magnetized regime, $\omega, \, \omega_p \ll \omega_B$,
the corresponding rotation rates are independent of the magnetic field. A
plasma screen with dispersion measure DM $\sim 10^{-6}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ can induce
large polarization changes, including large effective Rotation Measure (RM).
The frequency scaling of the (generalized) RM, $ \propto \lambda ^\alpha $,
mimics the conventional RM with $\alpha =2$ for small phase shifts, but can be
as small as $\alpha =1$. In interpreting observations the frequency scaling of
polarization parameters should be fitted independently. The model offers
explanations for (i) large circular polarization component observed in FRBs,
with right-left switching; (ii) large RM, with possible sign changes; (iii)
time-depend variable polarization. Relatively dense and slow wind is needed -
the corresponding effect in regular pulsars is small.

Radio wave scattering can cause severe reductions in detection sensitivity
for surveys of Galactic and extragalactic fast ($\sim$ms duration) transients.
While Galactic sources like pulsars undergo scattering in the Milky Way
interstellar medium (ISM), extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can also
experience scattering in their host galaxies and other galaxies intervening
their lines-of-sight. We assess Galactic and extragalactic scattering horizons
for fast radio transients using a combination of NE2001 to model the dispersion
measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) contributed by the Galactic disk, and
independently constructed electron density models for the Galactic halo and
other galaxies' ISMs and halos that account for different galaxy morphologies,
masses, densities, and strengths of turbulence. For source redshifts $0.5\leq
z_{\rm s}\leq1$, an all-sky, isotropic FRB population has simulated values of
$\tau(1\rm~GHz)$ ranging from $\sim1~\mu$s to $\sim2$ ms ($90\%$ confidence,
observer frame) that are dominated by host galaxies, although $\tau$ can be
$\gg2$ ms at low Galactic latitudes. A population at $z_{\rm s}=5$ has
$0.01\lesssim\tau\lesssim300$ ms at 1 GHz ($90\%$ confidence), dominated by
intervening galaxies. About $20\%$ of these high-redshift FRBs are predicted to
have $\tau>5$ ms at 1 GHz (observer frame), and $\gtrsim40\%$ of FRBs between
$z_{\rm s}\sim0.5-5$ have $\tau\gtrsim1$ ms for $\nu\leq 800$ MHz. Our
scattering predictions may be conservative if scattering from circumsource
environments is significant, which is possible under specific conditions. The
percentage of FRBs selected against from scattering could also be substantially
larger than we predict if circumgalactic turbulence causes more small-scale
($\ll1$ au) density fluctuations than observed from nearby halos.

The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20200120E is exceptional
because of its proximity ($d=3.6$ Mpc) and association with a globular cluster.
Here we report $60$ bursts detected with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope at 1.4
GHz. We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB
20200120E `burst storm', where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts
occurred within only 40 minutes. We find no strict periodicity in the burst
arrival times during the storm, nor any evidence for periodicity in the
source's activity between observations. The burst storm shows a steep burst
energy distribution (power-law index $\alpha = 2.39\pm0.12$) and a bi-modal
wait-time distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ s and
23.61$^{+3.06}_{-2.71}$ s. We attribute these peaks in the wait-time
distribution to a characteristic event timescale and pseudo-Poisson burst rate,
respectively. The secondary wait-time peak at $\sim1$ s is $\sim50\times$
longer than the $\sim30$ ms timescale seen for both FRB 20121102A and FRB
20201124A -- potentially indicating a larger emission region, or slower burst
propagation through this region. At the same time, FRB 20200120E shows, on
average, order-of-magnitude lower burst durations and luminosities compared
with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A. Lastly, in contrast to FRB 20121102A,
which has observed dispersion measure (DM) variations of $\Delta{\rm DM} >1$ pc
cm$^{-3}$ on month-to-year timescales, we determine that the DM of FRB
20200120E has remained stable ($\Delta{\rm DM} <0.15$ pc cm$^{-3}$) between
measurements separated by $>10$ months. Overall, the observational
characteristics of FRB 20200120E deviate quantitatively from other active
repeaters, but it is unclear whether it is qualitatively a different type of
source.

Long-term periodicity in the rate of flares is observed for two repeating
sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this paper We present a hydrodynamical
modeling of a massive binary consisting of a magnetar and an early-type star.
We model the interaction of the pulsar wind from the magnetar with an intense
stellar wind. It is shown that only during a fraction of the orbital period
radio emission can escape the system. This explains the duty cycle of the two
repeating FRB sources with periodic activity. The width of the transparency
window depends on the eccentricity, stellar wind properties, and the viewing
angle. To describe properties of the known sources it is necessary to assume
large eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.5$. We apply the maser cyclotron mechanism of
the radio emission generation to model spectral properties of the sources. The
produced spectrum is not wide: $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.2$ and the typical
frequency depends on the radius of the shock where the emission is generated.
The shock radius changes along the orbit. This, together with changing
parameters of the medium, allows us to explain the frequency drift during the
phase of visibility. Frequency dependence of the degree of polarization at few
GHz can be a consequence of a small scale turbulence in the shocked stellar
wind. It is much more difficult to explain huge ($\sim 10^5$ [rad/m$^2$]) and
variable value of the rotation measure observed for FRB 121102. We suggest that
this can be explained if the supernova explosion which produced the magnetar
happened near a dense interstellar cloud with $n \sim100$ cm$^{-3}$.

The most common form of magnetar activity is short X-ray bursts, with
durations from milliseconds to seconds, and luminosities ranging from $10^{36}$
to $10^{43}\ {\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. Recently, an X-ray burst from the
galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 was detected to be coincident with two fast
radio burst (FRB) like events from the same source, providing evidence that
FRBs may be linked to magnetar bursts. Using fully 3D force-free
electrodynamics simulations, we show that such magnetar bursts may be produced
by Alfv\'{e}n waves launched from localized magnetar quakes: a wave packet
propagates to the outer magnetosphere, becomes nonlinear, and escapes the
magnetosphere, forming an ultra-relativistic ejecta. The ejecta pushes open the
magnetospheric field lines, creating current sheets behind it. Magnetic
reconnection can happen at these current sheets, leading to plasma energization
and X-ray emission. The angular size of the ejecta can be compact, $\lesssim 1$
sr if the quake launching region is small, $\lesssim 0.01$ sr at the stellar
surface. We discuss implications for the FRBs and the coincident X-ray burst
from SGR 1935+2154.

We report on the discovery and localization of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from
the MeerTRAP project, a commensal fast radio transient-detection programme at
MeerKAT in South Africa. Our hybrid approach combines a coherent search with an
average field-of-view of 0.4 $\rm deg^{2}$ with an incoherent search utilizing
a field-of-view of $\sim$1.27 $\rm deg^{2}$ (both at 1284~MHz). Here, we
present results on the first three FRBs: FRB 20200413A (DM=1990.05 pc
cm$^{-3}$), FRB 20200915A (DM=740.65 pc cm$^{-3}$), and FRB 20201123A
(DM=433.55 pc cm$^{-3}$). FRB 20200413A was discovered only in the incoherent
beam. FRB 20200915A (also discovered only in the incoherent beam) shows
speckled emission in the dynamic spectrum which cannot be explained by
interstellar scintillation in our Galaxy or plasma lensing, and might be
intrinsic to the source. FRB 20201123A shows a faint post-cursor burst about
200 ms after the main burst and warrants further follow-up to confirm whether
it is a repeating FRB. FRB 20201123A also exhibits significant temporal
broadening consistent with scattering by a turbulent medium. The broadening
exceeds that predicted for medium along the sightline through our Galaxy. We
associate this scattering with the turbulent medium in the environment of the
FRB in the host galaxy. Within the approximately $1'$ localization region of
FRB 20201123A, we identify one luminous galaxy ($r \approx 15.67$;
J173438.35$-$504550.4) that dominates the posterior probability for a host
association. The galaxy's measured properties are consistent with other FRB
hosts with secure associations.

The search for neutrino events in correlation with several of the most
intense fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been performed using the Borexino data. We
have searched for signals with visible energies above $250$~keV within a time
window of $\pm$1000~s corresponding to the detection time of a particular FRB.
We also applied an alternative approach based on searching for specific shapes
of neutrino-electron scattering spectra in the full exposure spectrum of the
Borexino detector. In particular, two incoming neutrino spectra were
considered: the monoenergetic line and the spectrum expected from supernovae.
The same spectra were considered for electron antineutrinos detected through
the inverse beta-decay reaction. No statistically significant excess over the
background was observed. As a result, the strongest upper limits on
FRB-associated neutrino fluences of all flavors have been obtained in the $0.5
- 50$~MeV neutrino energy range.

Fast Radio Bursts must be powered by uniquely energetic emission mechanisms.
This requirement has eliminated a number of possible source types, but several
remain. Identifying the physical nature of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) emitters
arguably requires good localisation of more detections, and broadband studies
enabled by real-time alerting. We here present the Apertif Radio Transient
System (ARTS), a supercomputing radio-telescope instrument that performs
real-time FRB detection and localisation on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT) interferometer. It reaches coherent-addition sensitivity over
the entire field of the view of the primary dish beam. After commissioning
results verified the system performed as planned, we initiated the Apertif FRB
survey (ALERT). Over the first 5 weeks we observed at design sensitivity in
2019, we detected 5 new FRBs, and interferometrically localised each of these
to 0.4--10 sq. arcmin. All detections are broad band and very narrow, of order
1 ms duration, and unscattered. Dispersion measures are generally high. Only
through the very high time and frequency resolution of ARTS are these
hard-to-find FRBs detected, producing an unbiased view of the intrinsic
population properties. Most localisation regions are small enough to rule out
the presence of associated persistent radio sources. Three FRBs cut through the
halos of M31 and M33. We demonstrate that Apertif can localise one-off FRBs
with an accuracy that maps magneto-ionic material along well-defined lines of
sight. The rate of 1 every ~7 days next ensures a considerable number of new
sources are detected for such study. The combination of detection rate and
localisation accuracy exemplified by the 5 first ARTS FRBs thus marks a new
phase in which a growing number of bursts can be used to probe our Universe.

Fast radio burst (FRB) source 20180916B exhibits a 16.33-day periodicity in
its burst activity. It is as of yet unclear what proposed mechanism produces
the activity, but polarization information is a key diagnostic. Here, we report
on the polarization properties of 44 bursts from FRB 20180916B detected between
2018 December and 2021 December by CHIME/FRB, the FRB project on the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment. In contrast to previous observations, we find significant
variations in the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of FRB 20180916B. Over the nine
month period 2021 April$-$2021 December we observe an apparent secular increase
in $\rm{RM}$ of $\sim 50 \; \rm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ (a fractional change of over
$40\%$) that is accompanied by a possible drift of the emitting band to lower
frequencies. This interval displays very little variation in the dispersion
measure ($\Delta \rm{DM}\lesssim 0.8\; \rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$) which indicates that
the observed RM evolution is likely produced from coherent changes in the
Faraday-active medium's magnetic field. Burst-to-burst RM variations appear
unrelated to the activity cycle phase. The degree of linear polarization of our
burst sample ($\gtrsim 80\%$) is consistent with the negligible depolarization
expected for this source in the 400-800 MHz bandpass of CHIME. FRB 20180916B
joins other repeating FRBs in displaying substantial RM variations between
bursts. This is consistent with the notion that repeater progenitors may be
associated with young stellar populations by their preferential occupation of
dynamic magnetized environments commonly found in supernova remnants, pulsar
wind nebulae or near high mass stellar companions.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extra-galactic radio transients which exhibit a
distance-dependent dispersion of their signal, and thus can be used as
cosmological probes. In this article we, for the first time, apply a
model-independent approach to measure reionization from synthetic FRB data
assuming these signals are detected beyond redshift 5. This method allows us to
constrain the full shape of the reionization history as well as the CMB optical
depth $\tau$ while avoiding the problems of commonly used model-based
techniques. 100 localized FRBs, originating from redshifts 5-15, could
constrain (at 68% confidence level) the CMB optical depth to within 11%, and
the midpoint of reionization to 4%, surpassing current state-of-the-art CMB
bounds and quasar limits. Owing to the higher numbers of expected FRBs at lower
redshifts, the $\tau$ constraints are asymmetric (+14%, -7%) providing a much
stronger lower limit. Finally, we show that the independent constraints on
reionization from FRBs will improve limits on other cosmological parameters
such as the amplitude of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations.

Since FRB 200428 has been found to be associated with an X-ray burst from the
Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, it is interesting to explore whether the
magnetar bursts also follow the similar active periodic behavior as repeating
FRBs. Previous studies show that there is possible period about 230 day in SGR
J1935+2154 bursts. Here, we collected an updated burst sample from SGR
J1935+2154, including all bursts reported by Fermi/GBM and GECAM till 2022
January. We also developed a targeted search pipeline to uncover more bursts
from SGR J1935+2154 in the Fermi/GBM data from 2008 August to 2014 December
(i.e. before the first burst detected by Swift/BAT). With this burst sample, we
re-analyzed the possible periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts using the Period
Folding and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram methods. We caution that the observation
effects may introduce false periods (such as 55, 158, 238 and 498 day), as
evident in simulation tests. Finally, our results show that the most likely
period is 126.88$\pm$2.05 day, which might be interpreted as the precession of
the magnetar.However, we also note that the whole burst history is very
complicated and difficult to be perfectly accommodated with any period reported
thus far. More monitoring observations of SGR J1935+2154 are required to
further test any periodicity hypothesis.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients with an
observed dispersion measure ($DM$) greater than the expected Milky Way
contribution, which suggests that such events are of extragalactic origin.
Although some models have been proposed to explain the physics of the pulse,
the mechanism behind the FRBs emission still unknown. From FRBs data with known
host galaxies, the redshift is directly measured and can be combined with
estimates of the $DM$ to constrain the cosmological parameters, such as the
baryon number density and the Hubble constant. However, the poor knowledge of
the fraction of baryonic mass in the intergalactic medium ($f_{IGM}$) and its
degeneracy with the cosmological parameters impose limits on the cosmological
application of FRBs. In this work we present a model-independent method to
determine the evolution of $f_{IGM}$, combining the latest FRBs observations
with localized host galaxy and current supernovae data. In our analysis we
consider constant and time-dependent $f_{IGM}$ parameterizations and show,
through a Bayesian model selection analysis, that there is a strong evidence in
favor of a growing evolution of $f_{IGM}$ with redshift.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short, intense extragalactic radio bursts of
unknown origin. Recent polarimetric studies have shown that a noticeable
fraction of the repeating FRBs display irregular, short-time variations of the
Faraday rotation measure (RM). Moreover, evidence for rare propagation effects
such as Faraday conversion and polarized attenuation is seen in at least one
FRB repeater. Together, they suggest a highly variable magneto-active
circum-burst environment. In this paper, we report similar behavior in a
globular cluster pulsar binary system PSR B1744-24A. We observe irregular fast
changes of RM with both signs at random orbital phases as well as profile
changes of the circular polarization when the pulsar emission passes close to
the companion. The latter provides strong evidence for Faraday conversion and
circularly polarized attenuation. These similarities between PSR B1744-24A and
some FRB repeaters, as well as the possible binary-produced long-term
periodicity of two active repeaters, and the discovery of a nearby FRB in a
globular cluster, where pulsar binaries are common, all suggest that some
fraction of FRBs have binary companions.

Magnetars, a population of isolated neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic
fields of $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G, have been increasingly accepted to explain
a variety of astrophysical transients. A nascent millisecond-period magnetar
can release its spin-down energy and power bright sources such as Gamma-ray
Bursts (GRBs) and their subsequent X-ray plateaus, Super Luminous Supernovae
(SLSNe), and the fast X-ray transients such as CDF-S XT-2. Magnetars with ages
of $10^3-10^4$ years have been observed within the Milky Way Galaxy, which are
found to power diverse transients with the expense of their magnetic energy, in
the form of giant flares and repeated soft-$\gamma$-ray or hard X-ray bursts
and occasionally fast radio bursts (FRBs). Magnetar giant flares were also
detected as disguised short GRBs from nearby galaxies . Here we report the
identification of a GRB as a hyper flare of magnetar in a nearby galaxy. The
magnitude of the hyper flare is about one thousand times brighter than that of
a typical magnetar giant flare. A significant $\sim 80$ millisecond period is
detected in the decaying light curve. Interpreting this period as the rotation
period and given a magnetic field strength typical for a young magnetar, the
age of the magnetar is constrained to be only a few weeks. The non-detection of
a (superluminous) supernova nor a GRB weeks before the event further constrains
that the magnetar is likely born from an off-axis merger event of two neutron
stars. Our finding bridges the gap between the hypothetical millisecond
magnetars and the observed Galactic magnetars, and points toward a broader
channel of magnetar-powered gamma-ray transients.

The curvature radiation is applied to the explain the circular polarization
of FRBs. Significant circular polarization is reported in both apparently
non-repeating and repeating FRBs. Curvature radiation can produce significant
circular polarization at the wing of the radiation beam. In the curvature
radiation scenario, in order to see significant circular polarization in FRBs
(1) more energetic bursts, (2) burst with electrons having higher Lorentz
factor, (3) a slowly rotating neutron star at the centre are required.
Different rotational period of the central neutron star may explain why some
FRBs have high circular polarization, while others don't. Considering possible
difference in refractive index for the parallel and perpendicular component of
electric field, the position angle may change rapidly over the narrow pulse
window of the radiation beam. The position angle swing in FRBs may also be
explained by this non-geometric origin, besides that of the rotating vector
model.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04784v4
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be scattered by ionized gas in their local
environments, host galaxies, intervening galaxies along their lines-of-sight,
the intergalactic medium, and the Milky Way. The relative contributions of
these different media depend on their geometric configuration and the internal
properties of the gas. When these relative contributions are well understood,
FRB scattering is a powerful probe of density fluctuations along the
line-of-sight. The precise scattering measurements for FRB 121102 and FRB
180916 allow us to place an upper limit on the amount of scattering contributed
by the Milky Way halo to these FRBs. The scattering time $\tau\propto(\tilde{F}
\times {\rm DM}^2) A_\tau$, where ${\rm DM}$ is the dispersion measure,
$\tilde{F}$ quantifies electron density variations with $\tilde{F}=0$ for a
smooth medium, and the dimensionless constant $A_\tau$ quantifies the
difference between the mean scattering delay and the $1/e$ scattering time
typically measured. A likelihood analysis of the observed scattering and halo
DM constraints finds that $\tilde{F}$ is at least an order of magnitude smaller
in the halo than in the Galactic disk. The maximum pulse broadening from the
halo is $\tau\lesssim12$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz. We compare our analysis of the Milky
Way halo with other galaxy haloes by placing limits on the scattering
contributions from haloes intersecting the lines-of-sight to FRB 181112 and FRB
191108. Our results are consistent with haloes making negligible or very small
contributions to the scattering times of these FRBs.

The repeating FRB 20190520B is localized to a galaxy at $z=0.241$, much
closer than expected given its dispersion measure $\rm DM=1205\pm4\ pc\
cm^{-3}$. Here we assess implications of the large DM and scattering observed
from FRB 20190520B for the host galaxy's plasma properties. A sample of 75
bursts detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
shows scattering on two scales: a mean temporal delay $\tau(1.41\ {\rm
GHz})=10.9\pm1.5$ ms, which is attributed to the host galaxy, and a mean
scintillation bandwidth $\nu_{\rm d}(1.41\ {\rm GHz})=0.21\pm0.01$ MHz, which
is attributed to the Milky Way. Balmer line measurements for the host imply an
H$\alpha$ emission measure (galaxy frame) $\rm EM_s=620$ pc cm$^{-6} \times
(T/10^4 {\rm K})^{0.9}$, implying $\rm DM_{\rm H\alpha}$ of order the value
inferred from the FRB DM budget, $\rm DM_h=1121^{+89}_{-138}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ for
plasma temperatures greater than the typical value $10^4$ K. Combining $\tau$
and $\rm DM_h$ yields a nominal constraint on the scattering amplification from
the host galaxy $\tilde{F} G=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}$ (pc$^2$ km)$^{-1/3}$, where
$\tilde{F}$ describes turbulent density fluctuations and $G$ represents the
geometric leverage to scattering that depends on the location of the scattering
material. For a two-screen scattering geometry where $\tau$ arises from the
host galaxy and $\Delta \nu_{\rm d}$ from the Milky Way, the implied distance
between the FRB source and dominant scattering material is $\lesssim100$ pc.
The host galaxy scattering and DM contributions support a novel technique for
estimating FRB redshifts using the $\tau-\rm DM$ relation, and are consistent
with previous findings that scattering of localized FRBs is largely dominated
by plasma within host galaxies and the Milky Way.

Strong lensing of Fast Radio Bursts (FBRs) has been proposed as a relatively
clean probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. Recently, the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) published a first catalog of 536
FRBs, 62 of which are from repeating sources. In light of this new data, we
re-examine the prospects to constrain the abundance of PBHs via FRBs. Extending
previous forecasts, we calculate a PBH dark matter bound using the intrinsic
burst width and a calibrated flux-ratio threshold per FRB. In addition, we take
into account the uncertainty in the relation between the FRB dispersion measure
and source redshift. We outline an algorithm to detect lensed FRBs and a method
to simulate its performance on real data and set a flux-ratio threshold for
each event, which we use to infer realistic forecasts. We then attempt to
extract a preliminary bound using the publicly available CHIME data.
Unfortunately, both instrumental noise and the provided ~1 ms time-resolution
of the public data hinder this effort. We identify one candidate event where a
double burst could be explained via strong lensing by a 10 solar-mass PBH,
which will require follow-up study at higher time resolution to either confirm
or discard. We show that with a few times the size of the first catalog --
sampled at the full instrumental time-resolution so that candidates can be
efficiently scrutinized -- CHIME will be able to find strong evidence for or
robustly rule out PBHs with mass above 10 solar masses as the dark matter.
Finally, we demonstrate that stacking repeating FRBs can improve the
constraints, especially for lower masses.

Fast Radio Bursts (hereafter FRBs) can be used in cosmology by studying the
Dispersion Measure (hereafter DM) as a function of redshift. The large scale
structure of matter distribution is regarded as a major error budget for such
application. Using optical galaxy and dispersion measure mocks built from
N-body simulations, we have shown that the galaxy number density can be used as
a tracer for large scale electron density and help improve the measurement of
DM as a function of redshift. We have shown that, using the line-of-sight
galaxy number counts within 1' around the given localized FRB source can help
improve the cosmological parameter constraints by more than 20%.

We investigate the formation of multiple images as the radio signals from
fast radio bursts (FRBs) pass through the plane of a plasma clump. The
exponential model for the plasma clump is adopted to analyze the properties of
the multiple images. By comparing with the classical dispersion relations, we
find that one image has exhibited specific inverse properties to others, such
as their delay times at high frequency is higher than that at low frequency,
owing to the lensing effects of the plasma clump. We demonstrate that these
inverse effects should be observable in some repeating FRBs. Our results
predict deviation in the estimated DM across multiple images, consistent with
the observations of FRB 121102 and FRB 180916.J0158+65. If other plasma lenses
have effects similar to an exponential lens, we find that they should also give
rise to the similar dispersion relation in the multiple images. For some
repeating FRBs, analysis of the differences in time delay and in DM between
multiple images at different frequencies can serve as a method to reveal the
plasma distribution.

Recent observations of coherent radiation from the Crab pulsar (Bij et al
2021) suggest the emission is driven by an ultra - relativistic ($\gamma \sim
10^4$), cold plasma flow. A relativistically expanding plasma shell can
compress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce
coherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium
by $\gamma^2$. This mechanism has been studied in the past by Colgate and
Noerdelinger (1971), in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this
work we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast
radio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and
magnetic field requirements, allowing the spin down energy of regular (or even
recycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to
explain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time
evolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics and absence
of panchromatic counterparts. We also predict that the peak frequency of sub
pulses decline with observation time as $\omega_{\rm obs} \propto t_{\rm
obs}^{-1/2}$. Unfortunately, with current capabilities it is not possible to
constrain the shape of the curve $\omega_{\rm obs} \left(t_{\rm obs} \right)$.
Finally, we find that a variation of this model can explain weaker radio
transients, such as the one observed from a galactic magnetar. In this variant,
the shock wave produces low frequency photons which are then Compton scattered
to the GHz range.

The study of impulsive astrophysical radio emission makes it possible to
probe the intervening plasma between the emission source and the Earth. In cold
electron-ion plasmas, the circular propagating wave modes primarily alter the
linear polarization plane that scales with the inverse-square of the emission
frequency. In relativistic plasmas, the wave modes are elliptically polarized,
and it is possible to convert linearly polarized emission into circular and
vice versa. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) enable the study of not only the
electron-ion plasma of the intergalactic medium but potentially the extreme
magneto-ionic medium in which these intense pulses are produced. Here we report
on the polarimetric analysis of a repeat burst from the FRB 20201124A source.
The burst displayed a significant frequency-dependent circularly polarized
component, unlike other bursts from this source or any other FRB found to date.
We model the frequency dependence of the circular polarization using a
phenomenological generalized Faraday rotation framework. From this, we
interpret the observed circular polarization in the burst as having been
induced by radiative propagation through a relativistic plasma within or close
to the magnetosphere of the progenitor.

The dispersive sweep of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been used to probe the
ionized baryon content of the intergalactic medium, which is assumed to
dominate the total extragalactic dispersion. While the host galaxy
contributions to dispersion measure (DM) appear to be small for most FRBs, in
at least one case there is evidence for an extreme magneto-ionic local
environment and a compact persistent radio source. Here we report the detection
and localization of the repeating FRB 20190520B, which is co-located with a
compact, persistent radio source and associated with a dwarf host galaxy of
high specific star formation rate at a redshift $z=0.241\pm0.001$. The
estimated host galaxy DM $\approx 903^{+72}_{-111}$ pc cm$^{-3}$, nearly an
order of magnitude higher than the average of FRB host galaxies, far exceeds
the DM contribution of the intergalactic medium. Caution is thus warranted in
inferring redshifts for FRBs without accurate host galaxy identifications.

We analyze the slow periodicities identified in burst sequences from FRB
121102 and FRB 180916 with periods of about 16 and 160 d, respectively, while
also addressing the absence of any fast periodicity that might be associated
with the spin of an underlying compact object. Both phenomena can be accounted
for by a young, highly magnetized, precessing neutron star that emits beamed
radiation with significant imposed phase jitter. Sporadic narrow-beam emission
into an overall wide solid angle can account for the necessary phase jitter,
but the slow periodicities with 25 to 55 % duty cycles constrain beam
traversals to be significantly smaller. Instead, phase jitter may result from
variable emission altitudes that yield large retardation and aberration delays.
A detailed arrival-time analysis for triaxial precession includes wobble of the
radio beam and the likely larger, cyclical torque resulting from the changes in
the spin-magnetic moment angle. These effects will confound identification of
the fast periodicity in sparse data sets longer than about a quarter of a
precession cycle unless fitted for and removed as with orbital fitting.
Stochastic spin noise, likely to be much larger than in radio pulsars, may
hinder detection of any fast-periodicity in data spans longer than a few days.
These decoherence effects will dissipate as FRB sources age, so they may evolve
into objects with properties similar to Galactic magnetars.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration signals that are highly
dispersed at distant galaxies. However, the physical origin of FRBs is still
unknown. Coherent curvature emission by bunches, e.g., powered by starquakes,
has already been proposed for repeating FRBs. It has the nature of
understanding narrowband radiation exhibiting time--frequency drifting.
Recently, a highly active FRB source, i.e., FRB 20201124A, was reported to
enter a newly active episode and emit at least some highly circular-polarized
bursts. In this study, we revisit the polarized FRB emission, particularly
investigating the production mechanisms of a highly circular polarization (CP)
by deriving the intrinsic mechanism and propagative effect. The intrinsic
mechanisms of invoking charged bunches are approached with radiative coherence.
Consequently, a highly CP could naturally be explained by the coherent
summation of outcome waves, generated or scattered by bunches, with different
phases and electric vectors. Different kinds of evolutionary trajectories are
found on the Poincare sphere for the bunch-coherent polarization, and this
behavior could be tested through future observations. Cyclotron resonance can
result in the absorption of R-mode photons at a low altitude region of the
magnetosphere, and an FRB should then be emitted from a high-altitude region if
the waves have strong linear polarization. Circularly polarized components
could be produced from Faraday conversion exhibiting a \lambda^3-oscillation,
but the average CP fraction depends only on the income wave, indicating a
possibility of a highly circular-polarized income wave.The analysis could be
welcome if extremely high CP from repeating FRBs is detected in the future.
Finally, the production of a bulk of energetic bunches in the pulsar-like
magnetosphere is discussed, which is relevant to the nature of the FRB central
engine.

A sample of 14 FRBs with measured redshifts and scattering times is used to
assess contributions to dispersion and scattering from the intergalactic medium
(IGM), galaxy halos, and the disks of host galaxies. The IGM and galaxy halos
contribute significantly to dispersion measures but evidently not to
scattering, which is then dominated by host galaxies. This enables usage of
scattering times for estimating DM contributions from host galaxies and also
for a combined scattering-dispersion redshift estimator. Redshift estimation is
calibrated using scattering of Galactic pulsars after taking into account
different scattering geometries for Galactic and intergalactic lines of sight.
The DM-only estimator has a bias $\sim 0.1$ and RMS error $\sim 0.15$ in the
redshift estimate for an assumed ad-hoc value of 50 pc cm$^{-3}$ for the host
galaxy's DM contribution. The combined redshift estimator shows less bias by a
factor of four to ten and a 20 to 40% smaller RMS error. We find that values
for the baryonic fraction of the ionized IGM $f_{\rm igm} \sim 0.85 \pm 0.05$
optimize redshift estimation using dispersion and scattering. Our study
suggests that two of the 14 candidate galaxy associations (FRB 20190523 and
FRB~20190611B) should be reconsidered.

In this work, we present follow-up observations of two known repeating fast
radio bursts (FRBs) and seven non-repeating FRBs with complex morphology
discovered with CHIME/FRB. These observations were conducted with the Arecibo
Observatory 327 MHz receiver. We detected no additional bursts from these
sources, nor did CHIME/FRB detect any additional bursts from these sources
during our follow-up program. Based on these non-detections, we provide
constraints on the repetition rate, for all nine sources. We calculate
repetition rates using both a Poisson distribution of repetition and the
Weibull distribution of repetition presented by Oppermann et al. (2018). For
both distributions, we find repetition upper limits of the order $\lambda =
10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \text{hr}^{-1}$ for all sources. These rates are much lower
than those recently published for notable repeating FRBs like FRB 20121102A and
FRB 20201124A, suggesting the possibility of a low-repetition sub-population.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious cosmic sources emitting
millisecond-duration radio bursts\cite{Lorimer2007}. Although several hundreds
FRBs have been discovered\cite{TheCHIME/FRBCollaboration2021}, their physical
nature and central engine are still
unclear\cite{Cordes2019,Petroff2019,Zhang2020,Xiao2021}. The variations of
Faraday rotation measure and dispersion measure, due to local environment, are
crucial clues to understand their physical
nature\cite{Michilli2018,Anna-Thomas2022}. The recent observations on the
rotation measure of FRB 20201124A show a significant variation on a daytime
scale\cite{FAST21}. The variable rotation measure demonstrates that FRB
20201124A is in a dynamic magneto-ionic environment\cite{FAST21}. Intriguingly,
the oscillation of rotation measure supports that the local contribution can
change sign, which indicates the direction changes of the magnetic field along
the line of sight. Here we propose that this FRB resides in a binary system
containing a magnetar and a Be star with a decretion disk. When the magnetar
approaches the periastron, the propagation of radio waves through the disk of
the Be star naturally leads to the observed varying rotation measure,
depolarization, large scattering timescale, and Faraday conversion. Searching
for FRB signals from Be/X-ray binaries is encouraging.

Since April 28, 2020, Insight-HXMT has implemented a dedicated observation on
the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Thanks to the wide energy band (1-250 keV) and
high sensitivity of Insight-HXMT, we obtained 75 bursts from SGR J1935+2154
during a month-long activity episode after the emission of FRB 200428. Here, we
report the detailed time-integrated spectral analysis of these bursts and the
statistical distribution of the spectral parameters. We find that for
15%(11/75) of SGR J1935+2154 bursts, the CPL model is preferred, and most of
them occurred in the latter part of this active epoch. In the cumulative
fluence distribution, we find that the fluence of bursts in our sample is about
an order of magnitude weaker than that of Fermi/GBM, but follows the same power
law distribution. Finally, we find a burst with similar peak energy to the
time-integrated spectrum of the X-ray burst associated with FRB 200428 (FRB
200428-Associated Burst), but the low energy index is harder.

The $\Lambda$CDM model successfully explains the majority of cosmological
observations. However, the $\Lambda$CDM model is challenged by Hubble tension,
a remarkable difference of Hubble constant $H_0$ between measurements from
local probe and the prediction from Planck cosmic microwave background
observations under $ \Lambda$CDM model. So one urgently needs new distance
indicators to test the Hubble tension. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are
millisecond-duration pulses occurring at cosmological distances, which are
attractive cosmological probes. However, there is a thorny problem that the
dispersion measures (DMs) contributed by host galaxy and the inhomogeneities of
intergalactic medium cannot be exactly determined from observations. Previous
works assuming fixed values for them bring uncontrolled systematic error in
analysis. A reasonable approach is to handle them as probability distributions
extracted from cosmological simulations. Here we report a measurement of ${H_0}
= 64.67^{+5.62}_{-4.66} {\rm \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}$ using fourteen
localized FRBs, with an uncertainty of 8.7\% at 68.3 per cent confidence.
Thanks to the high event rate of FRBs and localization capability of radio
telescopes (i.e., Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder and Very Large
Array), future observations of a reasonably sized sample ($\sim$100 localized
FRBs) will provide a new way of measuring $H_0$ with a high precision
($\sim$2.6\%) to test the Hubble tension.

The gravitational field of compact objects, such as primordial black holes,
can create multiple images of background sources. For transients such as fast
radio bursts (FRBs), these multiple images can be resolved in the time domain.
Under certain circumstances, these images not only have similar burst
morphologies but are also phase-coherent at the electric field level. With a
novel dechannelization algorithm and a matched filtering technique, we search
for repeated copies of the same electric field waveform in observations of FRBs
detected by the FRB backend of the Canadian Hydrogen Mapping Intensity
Experiment (CHIME). An interference fringe from a coherent gravitational
lensing signal will appear in the time-lag domain as a
statistically-significant peak in the time-lag autocorrelation function. We
calibrate our statistical significance using telescope data containing no FRB
signal. Our dataset consists of $\sim$100-ms long recordings of voltage data
from 172 FRB events, dechannelized to 1.25-ns time resolution. This coherent
search algorithm allows us to search for gravitational lensing signatures from
compact objects in the mass range of $10^{-4}-10^{4} ~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$.
After ruling out an anomalous candidate due to diffractive scintillation, we
find no significant detections of gravitational lensing in the 172 FRB events
that have been analyzed. In a companion work [Leung, Kader+2022], we interpret
the constraints on dark matter from this search.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06001v1
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent an exciting frontier in the study of
gravitational lensing, due to their brightness, extragalactic nature, and the
compact, coherent characteristics of their emission. In a companion work
[Kader, Leung+2022], we use a novel interferometric method to search for
gravitationally lensed FRBs in the time domain using bursts detected by
CHIME/FRB. There, we dechannelize and autocorrelate electric field data at a
time resolution of 1.25 ns. This enables a search for FRBs whose emission is
coherently deflected by gravitational lensing around a foreground compact
object such as a primordial black hole (PBH). Here, we use our non-detection of
lensed FRBs to place novel constraints on the PBH abundance outside the Local
Group. We use a novel two-screen model to take into account decoherence from
scattering screens in our constraints. Our constraints are subject to a single
astrophysical model parameter -- the effective distance between an FRB source
and the scattering screen, for which we adopt a fiducial distance of 1 parsec.
We find that coherent FRB lensing is a sensitive probe of sub-solar mass
compact objects. Having observed no lenses in $172$ bursts from $114$
independent sightlines through the cosmic web, we constrain the fraction of
dark matter made of compact objects, such as PBHs, to be $f \lesssim 0.8$, if
their masses are $\sim 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$.

Popular Fast Radio Burst models involve rotating magnetized neutron stars,
yet no rotational periodicities have been found. Small datasets exclude exact
periodicity in FRB 121102. Recent observations of over 1500 bursts from each of
FRB 121102 and FRB 20201124A also have not found periodicity. Periodograms of
events with cosine-distributed random offsets as large as $\pm 0.6 P$ from a
strict period $P$ would still reveal the underlying periodicity. The
sensitivity of periodograms of long data series, such as bursts observed on
multiple days, to slow frequency drifts is mitigated by considering individual
observing sessions, and results are shown for FRB 121102. Models of repeating
FRB without intrinsic periodicity are considered, as are models of apparently
non-repeating FRB.

In this work we report the results of a nineteen-month Fast Radio Burst
observational campaign carried out with the North-South arm of the Medicina
Northern Cross radio telescope at 408~MHz in which we monitored four repeating
sources: FRB20180916B, FRB20181030A, FRB20200120E and FRB20201124A. We present
the current state of the instrument and the detection and characterisation of
three bursts from FRB20180916B. Given our observing time, our detections are
consistent with the event number we expect from the known burst rate ($2.7 \pm
1.9$ above our 10$\sigma$, 38~Jy~ms detection threshold) in the 5.2 day active
window of the source, further confirming the source periodicity. We detect no
bursts from the other sources. We turn this result into a 95\% confidence level
lower limit on the slope of the differential fluence distribution $\alpha$ to
be $\alpha > 2.1$ and $\alpha > 2.2$ for FRB20181030A and FRB20200120E
respectively. Given the known rate for FRB20201124A, we expect $1.0 \pm 1.1$
bursts from our campaign, consistent with our non-detection.

The origin(s) and mechanism(s) of fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are short
radio pulses from cosmological distances, have remained a major puzzle since
their discovery. We report a strong Quasi-Periodic Oscillation(QPO) of 40 Hz in
the X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 and associated with FRB
200428, significantly detected with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope
(Insight-HXMT) and also hinted by the Konus-Wind data. QPOs from magnetar
bursts have only been rarely detected; our 3.4 sigma (p-value is 2.9e-4)
detection of the QPO reported here reveals the strongest QPO signal observed
from magnetars (except in some very rare giant flares), making this X-ray burst
unique among magnetar bursts. The two X-ray spikes coinciding with the two FRB
pulses are also among the peaks of the QPO. Our results suggest that at least
some FRBs are related to strong oscillation processes of neutron stars. We also
show that we may overestimate the significance of the QPO signal and
underestimate the errors of QPO parameters if QPO exists only in a fraction of
the time series of a X-ray burst which we use to calculate the Leahy-normalized
periodogram.

The mechanism that produces fast radio burst (FRB) emission is poorly
understood. Targeted monitoring of repeating FRB sources provides the
opportunity to fully characterize the emission properties in a manner
impossible with one-off bursts. Here, we report observations of the source of
FRB 20201124A, with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)
and the ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver at the Parkes 64-m radio telescope
(Murriyang). The source entered a period of emitting bright bursts during early
2021 April. We have detected 16 bursts from this source. One of the bursts
detected with ASKAP is the brightest burst ever observed from a repeating FRB
source with an inferred fluence of $640\pm70$ Jy ms. Of the five bursts
detected with the Parkes UWL, none display any emission in the range 1.1--4
GHz. All UWL bursts are highly polarized, with their Faraday rotation measures
(RMs) showing apparent variations. We obtain an average RM of $-614$ rad
m$^{-2}$ for this FRB source with a standard deviation of $16$ rad m$^{-2}$ in
the UWL bursts. In one of the UWL bursts, we see evidence of significant
circularly polarized emission with a fractional extent of $47\pm1$ per cent.
Such a high degree of circular polarization has never been seen before in
bursts from repeating FRB sources. We also see evidence for significant
variation in the linear polarization position angle in the pulse profile of
this UWL repeat burst. Models for repeat burst emission will need to account
for the increasing diversity in the burst polarization properties.

Magnetars are neutron stars with extreme magnetic field and sometimes
manifest as soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). SGR J1935+2154 is one of the most
prolific bursters and the first confirmed source of fast radio burst (i.e. FRB
200428). Encouraged by the discovery of the first X-ray counterpart of FRB,
Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) implemented a dedicated
33-day long ToO observation of SGR J1935+2154 since April 28, 2020. With the
HE, ME, and LE telescopes, Insight-HXMT provides a thorough monitoring of burst
activity evolution of SGR J1935+2154, in a very broad energy range (1-250 keV)
with high temporal resolution and high sensitivity, resulting in a unique
valuable data set for detailed studies of SGR J1935+2154. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive analysis of this observation including detailed burst
search, identification and temporal analyses. After carefully removing false
triggers, we find a total of 75 bursts from SGR J1935+2154, out of which 70 are
single-pulsed. The maximum burst rate is about 56 bursts/day. Both the burst
duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow log-normal
distributions, consistent with previous studies. We also find that bursts with
longer duration (some are multi-pulsed) tend to occur during the period with
relatively high burst rate. There is no correlation between the waiting time
and the fluence or duration of either the former or latter burst. It also seems
that there is no correlation between burst duration and hardness ratio, in
contrast to some previous reports. In addition, we do not find any X-ray burst
associated with any reported radio bursts except for FRB 200428.

Recent observations of FRB 20190520B have revealed rapid fluctuation of its
Dispersion Measure within apparently fixed bounds, as well as a reversal of its
Rotation Measure. The fluctuations of Dispersion Measure are uncorrelated with
the intervals between bursts, setting upper bounds $\sim 10\,$s on any
characteristic time scale of the dispersing region; it must be very compact.
Measurements of the full dependence of the dispersive time delay on frequency
may determine the actual electron density and the size of this region. It is
possible to set a lower bound on the mass of the FRB source from constraints on
the size of the dispersing region and its time scale of variation. Comparison
of the variations of DM and RM leads to an estimate of the magnetic field $\sim
500\,\mu$G.

The era of fast radio bursts (FRBs) was open in 2007, when a very bright
radio pulse of unknown origin was discovered occasionally in the archival data
of Parkes Telescope. Over the past fifteen years, this mysterious phenomenon
have caught substantial attention among the scientific community and become one
of the hottest topic in high-energy astrophysics. The total number of events
has a dramatic increase to a few hundred recently, benefiting from new
dedicated surveys and improved observational techniques. Our understanding of
these bursts has been undergoing a revolutionary growth with observational
breakthroughs announced consistently. In this chapter, we will give a
comprehensive introduction of FRBs, including the latest progress. Starting
from the basics, we will go through population study, inherent physical
mechanism, and all the way to the application in cosmology. Plenty of open
questions exist right now and there is more surprise to come in this active
young field.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmological radio transients with unclear
generation mechanism. Known characteristics such as their luminosity, duration,
spectrum and repetition rate, etc. suggest that FRBs are powerful coherent
radio signals at GHz frequencies, but the status of FRBs near source remain
unknown. As an extreme astronomical event, FRBs should be accompanied by energy
-- comparable or even more powerful x/{\gamma}-ray counterparts. Here,
particle-in-cell simulations of ultra-strong GHz radio pulse interaction with
GeV photons show that at 3*10^12V/cm field-strengths, quantum cascade can
generate dense pair plasmas, which greatly dampen the radio pulse. Thus, in the
presence of GeV photons in the source region, GHz radio pulses stronger than
3*10^12V/cm cannot escape. This result indicates an upper field-strength limit
of FRB at the source.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are recently discovered extra-galactic radio
transients which are now used as novel cosmological probes. We show how the
Bursts' Dispersion Measure can model-independently probe the history of
Hydrogen reionization. Using a FlexKnot free-form parameterization to
reconstruct the reionization history we predict an 11% accuracy constraint on
the CMB optical depth, and 4% accuracy on the midpoint of reionization, to be
achieved with 100 FRBs originating from redshifts z>5.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious transient phenomena. The study of
repeating FRBs may provide useful information about their nature due to their
redetectability. The two most famous repeating sources are FRBs 121102 and
180916, with a period of 157 days and 16.35 days, respectively. Previous
studies suggest that the periodicity of FRBs is likely associated with neutron
star (NS) binary systems. Here we introduce a new model which proposes that
periodic repeating FRBs are due to the interaction of a NS with its planet in a
highly elliptical orbit. The periastron of the planet is very close to the NS
so that it would be partially disrupted by tidal force every time it passes
through the periastron. Fragments generated in the process could interact with
the compact star through the Alfv\'{e}n wing mechanism and produce FRBs. The
model can naturally explain the repeatability of FRBs with a period ranging
from a few days to several hundred days, but it generally requires that the
eccentricity of the planet's orbit should be large enough. Taking FRBs 121102
and 180916 as examples, it is shown that the main features of the observed
repeating behaviors can be satisfactorily accounted for.

We search for gravitational-wave transients associated with fast radio bursts
(FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast
Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB), during the first part of the third observing
run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo (1 April 2019 15:00 UTC-1 Oct 2019
15:00 UTC). Triggers from 22 FRBs were analyzed with a search that targets
compact binary coalescences with at least one neutron star component. A
targeted search for generic gravitational-wave transients was conducted on 40
FRBs. We find no significant evidence for a gravitational-wave association in
either search. Given the large uncertainties in the distances of the FRBs
inferred from the dispersion measures in our sample, however, this does not
conclusively exclude any progenitor models that include emission of a
gravitational wave of the types searched for from any of these FRB events. We
report $90\%$ confidence lower bounds on the distance to each FRB for a range
of gravitational-wave progenitor models. By combining the inferred maximum
distance information for each FRB with the sensitivity of the
gravitational-wave searches, we set upper limits on the energy emitted through
gravitational waves for a range of emission scenarios. We find values of order
$10^{51}$-$10^{57}$ erg for a range of different emission models with central
gravitational wave frequencies in the range 70-3560 Hz. Finally, we also found
no significant coincident detection of gravitational waves with the repeater,
FRB 20200120E, which is the closest known extragalactic FRB.

Some repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources exhibit complex polarization
behaviors, including frequency-dependent depolarization, variation of rotation
measure (RM), and oscillating spectral structures of polarized components. Very
recently, Feng et al. (2022) reported that active repeaters exhibit conspicuous
frequency-dependent depolarization and a strong correlation between RM scatter
($\sigma_{\rm RM}$) and the temporal scattering time ($\tau_{\rm s}$),
$\sigma_{\rm RM}\propto\tau_{\rm s}^{1.0\pm0.2}$, both of which can be well
described by multi-path propagation through a magnetized inhomogeneous plasma
screen. This observation strongly suggests that the temporal scattering and RM
scatter originate from the same region. Besides, a particular finding of note
in Feng et al. (2022) is that the FRBs with compact persistent radio sources
(PRS) tend to have extreme $\sigma_{\rm RM}$. In this work, we focus on some
theoretical predictions on the relations among temporal scattering,
depolarization by RM scatter, and PRS contributed by the magnetized plasma
environment close to a repeating FRB source. The behaviors of the RM scatter
imply that the magnetized plasma environment is consistent with a supernova
remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, and the predicted $\sigma_{\rm RM}$-$\tau_{\rm
s}$ relation is $\sigma_{\rm RM}\propto\tau_{\rm s}^{(0.54-0.83)}$ for
different astrophysical scenarios. We further make a general discussion on PRS
that does not depend on specific astrophysical scenarios. We show that the
specific luminosity of a PRS should have a positive correlation with the RM
contributed by the plasma screen. This is consistent with the observations of
FRB 121102 and FRB 190520B.

The polarization of fast radio bursts (FRBs), bright astronomical transients,
contains crucial information about their environments. We report polarization
measurements of five repeating FRBs, the abundant signals of which enable
wide-band observations with two telescopes. A clear trend of lower polarization
at lower frequencies was found, which can be well characterized by a single
parameter rotation-measure-scatter ({\sigma}RM) and modeled by multi-path
scatter. Sources with higher {\sigma}RM have higher RM magnitude and scattering
timescales. The two sources with the most substantial {\sigma}RM, FRB 20121102A
and FRB 20190520B, are associated with a compact persistent radio source. These
properties indicate a complex environment near the repeating FRBs, such as a
supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, consistent with their arising from
young populations.

The application of fast radio bursts (FRBs) as probes to investigate
astrophysics and cosmology requires the proper modelling of the dispersion
measures of Milky Way (${\rm DM_{MW}}$) and host galaxy (${\rm DM_{host}}$).
${\rm DM_{MW}}$ can be estimated using the Milky Way electron models, such as
NE2001 model and YMW16 model. However, ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is hard to model due
to limited information on the local environment of FRBs. In this paper, using
17 well-localized FRBs, we search for the possible correlations between ${\rm
DM_{host}}$ and the properties of host galaxies, such as the redshift, the
stellar mass, the star-formation rate, the age of galaxy, the offset of FRB
site from galactic center, and the half-light radius. We find no strong
correlation between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and any of the host property. Assuming
that ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is a constant for all host galaxies, we constrain the
fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium today to be $f_{\rm
IGM,0}=0.78_{-0.19}^{+0.15}$. If we model ${\rm DM_{host}}$ as a log-normal
distribution, however, we obtain a larger value, $f_{\rm
IGM,0}=0.83_{-0.17}^{+0.12}$. Based on the limited number of FRBs, no strong
evidence for the redshift evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}$ is found.

We model the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) dispersion measure (DM) distribution for
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and compare this
with the four FRBs published in the literature to date. We compare the DM
distribution of Parkes and FAST, taking advantage of the similarity between
their multibeam receivers. Notwithstanding the limited sample size, we observe
a paucity of events at low DM for all evolutionary models considered, resulting
in a sharp rise in the observed cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the
region of $1000\lesssim\mathrm{DM}\lesssim2000$ pc cm$^{-3}$. These traits
could be due to statistical fluctuations ($0.12 \le p \le 0.22$), a complicated
energy distribution or break in an energy distribution power law, spatial
clustering, observational bias or outliers in the sample (e.g., an excessive
DM_${HOST}$ as recently found for FRB 20190520B). The energy distribution in
this regime is unlikely to be adequately constrained until further events are
detected. Modelling suggests that FAST may be well placed to discriminate
between redshift evolutionary models and to probe the helium ionisation signal
of the IGM.

The environment of actively repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been shown
to be complex and varying. The recently localized FRB 20190520B is extremely
active, has the largest confirmed host dispersion measure, and is only the
second FRB source associated with a compact, persistent radio source (PRS). The
main tracer of the magneto-ionic environments is the rotation measure (RM), a
path-integral of the line-of-sight component of magnetic field strength (B) and
electron density, which does not allow a direct probe of the B-field
configuration. Here we report direct evidence for a B-field reversal based on
the observed sign change and extreme variation of FRB 20190520B's RM, which
changed from $\sim10000$ rad m$^{-2}$ to $\sim-16000$ rad m$^{-2}$ between June
2021 and January 2022. Such extreme RM reversal has never been observed before
in any FRB nor in any astronomical object. The implied short-term change of the
B-field configuration in or around the FRB could be due to the vicinity of
massive black holes, or a magnetized companion star in binary systems, or a
young supernova remnant along the line of sight.

FRB 180916.J0158+65 is one of the nearest, periodically repeating, and
actively bursting fast radio burst (FRB) which has been localized to the
outskirts of a spiral galaxy. In this work we study the FRB with the hard X-ray
$14-195$ keV data from the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board The Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory. BAT uses coded mask technology giving a localization
of $\lesssim 3$ arc-minute in the hard X-ray band, along with an accurate
background estimation. BAT has been observing the source location in survey
mode since February 2020. The survey mode observations involves background
subtracted spectra, integrated over a time span ranging $300-2000$ seconds, at
the source location (from Feb 2020-Jan 2022). We analyzed all the $\sim 230$
survey mode observations from BAT and checked for any signal in any of the
observations. We did not detect any signal at $>5\sigma$ confidence level in
any of the observations. We could estimate a $5\sigma$ upper limit on the
$14-195$ keV flux, which ranged between $4.5\times 10^{-10} - 7.6\times
10^{-9}\, \rm erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}$. At the source distance this relates to a
$5\sigma$ upper limit on luminosity of $5.08\times 10^{44}- 8.5\times 10^{45}
\rm erg\, s^{-1}$. With this estimate, we could rule out any persistent X-ray
emission, at the source location for these snapshots of BAT observations.

FRB180301 is one of the most actively repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs)
which has shown polarization angle changes in its radio burst emission, an
indication for their likely origin in the magnetosphere of a highly-magnetized
neutron star. We carried out a multi-wavelength campaign with the FAST radio
telescope and NICER X-ray observatory to investigate any possible X-ray
emission temporally coincident with the bright radio bursts. The observations
took place on 2021 March 4, 9 and 19. We detected five bright radio bursts with
FAST, four of which were strictly simultaneous with the NICER observations. The
peak flux-density of the radio bursts ranged between $28-105$ mJy, the burst
fluence between $27-170$ mJy-ms, and the burst durations between $1.7-12.3$ ms.
The radio bursts from FRB~180301 exhibited complex time domain structure, and
sub-pulses were detected in individual bursts, with no significant circular
polarisation. The linear degree of polarisation in L-band reduced significantly
compared to the 2019 observations. We do not detect any X-ray emission in
excess of the background during the 5ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1sec and 100sec time
intervals at/around the radio-burst barycenter-corrected arrival times, at a
$>5\sigma$ confidence level. The $5\sigma$ upper limits on the X-ray a)
persistent flux is $<7.64\times 10^{-12}\, \rm erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}$ ,
equivalent to $L_{\rm X}<2.50 \times 10^{45} \rm erg\, s^{-1}$ and b) 5 ms
fluence is $<2\times 10^{-11} \rm erg\, cm^{-2}$, at the radio burst regions.
Using the $5$ ms X-ray fluence upper limit, we can estimate the radio
efficiency $\eta_{R/X} \equiv L_{\rm Radio}/L_{\rm X-ray} \gtrsim 10^{-8}$. The
derived upper limit on $\eta_{R/X}$ is consistent with both magnetospheric
models and synchrotron maser models involving relativistic shocks.

The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unclear. Finding
multiwavelength counterparts of FRBs can be a breakthrough in understanding
their nature. In this work, we perform a systematic search for astronomical
transients (ATs) whose positions are consistent with FRBs. We find an
unclassified optical transient AT2020hur ($\alpha=01^{\mathrm{h}}
58^{\mathrm{m}} 00.750^{\mathrm{s}} \pm 1$ arcsec, $\delta=65^{\circ}
43^{\prime} 00.30^{\prime \prime} \pm 1$ arcsec) that is spatially coincident
with the repeating FRB 180916B ($\alpha=01^{\mathrm{h}} 58^{\mathrm{m}}
00.7502^{\mathrm{s}} \pm 2.3$ mas, $\delta=65^{\circ} 43^{\prime}
00.3152^{\prime \prime} \pm 2.3$ mas). The chance possibility for the
AT2020hur-FRB 180916B association is about 0.04%, which corresponds to a
significance of $3.5\sigma$. We develop a giant flare afterglow model to fit
AT2020hur. Although the giant flare afterglow model can interpret the
observations of AT2020hur, the derived kinetic energy of such a GF is at least
three orders of magnitude larger than that of the typical GF, and there is a
lot of fine tuning and coincidences required for this model. Another possible
explanation is that AT2020hur might consist of two or more optical flares
originating from the FRB source, e.g. fast optical bursts produced by the
inverse Compton scattering of FRB emission. Besides, AT2020hur is located in
one of the activity windows of FRB 180916B, which is an independent support for
the association. This coincidence may be due to the reason that the optical
counterpart is subject to the same periodic modulation as FRB 180916B, as
implied by the prompt FRB counterparts. Future simultaneous observations of
FRBs and their optical counterparts may help reveal their physical origin.

The recent detection of a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) from a Galactic magnetar
secured the fact that neutron stars (NSs) with super-strong magnetic fields are
capable of producing these extremely bright coherent radio bursts. One of the
leading mechanisms to explain the origin of such coherent radio emission is the
curvature radiation process within the dipolar magnetic field structure. It
has, however, already been demonstrated that magnetars likely have a more
complex magnetic field topology. Here we critically investigate curvature radio
emission in the presence of inclined dipolar and quadrupolar ("quadrudipolar")
magnetic fields and show that such field structures differ in their angular
characteristics from a purely dipolar case. We analytically show that the shape
of open field lines can be modified significantly depending on both the ratio
of quadrupole to dipole field strength and their inclination angle at the NS
surface. This creates multiple points along each magnetic field line that
coincides with the observer's line of sight and may explain the complex
spectral and temporal structure of the observed FRBs. We also find that in
quadrudipole, the radio beam can take a wider angular range and the beam width
can be wider than in pure dipole. This may explain why the pulse width of the
transient radio pulsation from magnetars is as large as that of ordinary radio
pulsars.

We revisit the eccentric neutron star (NS)-white dwarf (WD) binary model for
the periodic activity of fast radio burst (FRB) sources, by including the
effects of gravitational wave (GW) radiation. In this model, the WD fills its
Roche lobe at the periastron and mass transfer occurs from the WD to the NS.
The accreted materials can be fragmented and arrive at the NS episodically,
resulting in multiple bursts through curvature radiation. Consequently, the WD
may be kicked away owing to the conservation of angular momentum. To initiate
the next mass transfer, the WD has to refill its Roche lobe through GW
radiation. In this scenario, whether the periodic activity can show up relies
on three timescales, i.e., the orbital period $P_{\rm orb}$, the timescale
$T_{\rm GW}$ for the Roche lobe to be refilled, and the time span $T_{\rm
frag}$ for all the episodic events corresponding to each mass transfer process.
Only when the two conditions $T_{\rm GW} \gtrsim P_{\rm orb}$ and $T_{\rm frag}
< P_{\rm orb}$ are both satisfied, the periodic activity will manifest itself
and the period should be equal to $P_{\rm orb}$. In this spirit, the periodic
activity is more likely to show up for relatively long periods ($P_{\rm orb}
\gtrsim$ several days). Thus, it is reasonable that FRBs 180916 and 121102, the
only two sources having been claimed to manifest periodic activity, both
correspond to relatively long periods.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are pulsed radio signals with a duration of
milliseconds and a large dispersion measure (DM). Recent observations indicate
that FRB 180916 and FRB 121102 show periodic activities. Some theoretical
models have been proposed to explain periodic FRBs, and here we test these
using corresponding X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations. We find that the
orbital periodic model, the free precession model, the radiation-driven
precession model, the fall-back disk precession model where eccentricity is due
to the internal magnetic field, and the rotation periodic model are not
consistent with observations. The geodetic precession model is the most likely
periodic model for FRB 180916. We also propose methods to test the periodic
models with yet-to-be-obtained observational data in the future.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent one of the most exciting astrophysical
discoveries of the recent past. The study of their low-frequency emission,
which was only effectively picked up about ten years after their discovery, has
helped shape the field thanks to some of the most important detections to date.
Observations between 400 and 800 MHz, carried out by the CHIME/FRB telescope,
in particular, have led to the detection of ~500 FRBs in little more than 1
year and, among them, ~20 repeating sources. Detections at low frequencies have
uncovered a nearby population that we can study in detail via continuous
monitoring and targeted campaigns. The latest, most important discoveries
include: periodicity, both at the days level in repeaters and at the
millisecond level in apparently non-repeating sources; the detection of an
FRB-like burst from a galactic magnetar; and the localisation of an FRB inside
a globular cluster in a nearby galaxy. The systematic study of the population
at low frequencies is important for the characterisation of the environment
surrounding the FRBs and, at a global level, to understand the environment of
the local universe. This review is intended to give an overview of the efforts
leading to the current rich variety of low-frequency studies and to put into a
common context the results achieved in order to trace a possible roadmap for
future progress in the field.

There are insufficient catastrophic events (collapse, explosion or merger of
stars or compact objects) to explain the cosmologically local rate of
apparently non-repeating FRB if each such catastrophic event produces a single
FRB. Unless produced by some novel and unsuspected but comparatively frequent
event, apparently non-repeating FRB must actually repeat many times in the
lifetimes of their sources. Yet no such infrequent repetitions (in contrast to
the frequent activity of FRB known to repeat) have been observed, constraining
their repetition rates and active lifetimes. The absence of more frequent
weaker but detectable repetitive outbursts in apparent non-repeaters resembles
the distribution of SGR outbursts, with a large gap between giant outbursts and
lesser outbursts. This suggests mini-SGR as sources, more energetic than SGR
1935$+$2154 associated with FRB 200428 but less energetic than SGR 1806$-$20
that had no associated FRB. Their largest radio outbursts would, at
cosmological distances, be apparently non-repeating FRB and their X-ray and
gamma-ray outbursts would be undetectable. The large gap between the strongest
outburst of FRB 200428 and its lesser outbursts resembles the gamma-ray
properties of individual well-observed SGR; at twenty times its actual
distance, FRB 200428 would have been an apparent non-repeater.

We introduce a new portfolio credit risk model based on Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBMs), which are stochastic neural networks capable of universal
approximation of loss distributions. We test the model on an empirical dataset
of default probabilities of 30 investment-grade US companies and we show that
it outperforms commonly used parametric factor copula models -- such as the
Gaussian or the t factor copula models -- across several credit risk management
tasks. In particular, the model leads to better out-of-sample fits for the
empirical loss distribution and more accurate risk measure estimations. We
introduce an importance sampling procedure which allows risk measures to be
estimated at high confidence levels in a computationally efficient way and
which is a substantial improvement over the Monte Carlo techniques currently
available for copula models. Furthermore, the statistical factors extracted by
the model admit an interpretation in terms of the underlying portfolio sector
structure and provide practitioners with quantitative tools for the management
of concentration risk. Finally, we show how to use the model for stress testing
by estimating stressed risk measures (e.g. stressed VaR) for our empirical
portfolio under various macroeconomic stress test scenarios, such as those
specified by the FRB's Dodd-Frank Act stress test.

Fast radio bursts are brief, intense flashes of radio waves that arise from
unknown sources in galaxies across the universe. Observations of the
polarization properties in repeating fast radio bursts have shown they can
reside in highly magnetized environments, such as in the immediate vicinity of
a recent supernova or massive black hole. We have observed the actively
repeating FRB 20190520B over a span of fourteen months and found that its
Faraday rotation measure is both large in magnitude and rapidly varying,
including two sign changes which indicate time-dependent orientation changes of
the magnetic field along our line of sight. The FRB also depolarizes rapidly at
lower frequencies. These phenomena can be explained in terms of multi-path
propagation through a highly turbulent, dense magnetized screen within a range
of 8 AU to 100 pc away from the FRB source, distinctly narrowing the possible
physical configurations that could give rise to the emission seen in FRB
20190520B.

We study milliarcsecond-scale properties of the persistent radio counterpart
to FRB 121102 and investigate the spectro-polarimetric properties of a bright
burst. For the former, we use European VLBI Network (EVN) observations in 2017
at 1.7 and 4.8 GHz. For the latter, we re-analyse the 1.7-GHz data from the
100-m Effelseberg telescope taken in 2016. These observations predate other
polarimetric studies of FRB 121102, and yield the highest burst Faraday
rotation measure (RM) to date, RM = 1.27*10^5 rad m^-2, consistent with the
decreasing RM trend. The fractional polarization of the burst emission is 15%
at 1.7 GHz. This can be reconciled with the high fractional polarization at
higher frequencies if the Faraday width of the burst environment is 150 rad
m^-2 - a bare 0.1% of the total Faraday rotation. The width may originate from
minor non-uniformities in the Faraday screen, or from effects in the emitting
region itself. The upper limit on the persistent source size is 1 pc, barely
consistent with a young supernova (SN) scenario. The flux variability limit of
<10% is not in favor of the young SN scenario, and challenges other
interpretations as well. The fractional polarization of the faint persistent
source is constrained at <25% at 4.8 GHz ruling out a common origin with the
highly polarized individual bursts.

The CHIME/FRB collaboration has recently published a catalog containing about
half a thousand fast radio bursts (FRBs) including their spectra and several
reconstructed properties, like signal widths, amplitudes, etc. We have
developed a model-independent approach for a classification of these bursts
using cross-correlation and clustering algorithms applied to one-dimensional
intensity profiles of the bursts (i.e., to amplitudes as a function of time
averaged over the frequency). Using this algorithm we identified two major
classes of FRBs featuring different waveform morphology, and, simultaneously,
different distribution of brightness temperature. Bursts from one of the
identified cluster have lower brightness temperatures and larger widths than
events from the other cluster. Both groups include bursts from the repeaters
and one-off events.

In the next decades, it is necessary to forge new late-universe cosmological
probes to precisely constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of
dark energy simultaneously. In this work, we show that the four typical
late-universe cosmological probes, the 21 cm intensity mapping (IM), fast radio
burst (FRB), gravitational wave (GW) standard siren, and strong gravitational
lensing (SGL), are expected to be forged into useful tools in solving the
Hubble tension and exploring dark energy. We propose that the synergy of them
is rather important in cosmology. We simulate the 21 cm IM, FRB, GW, and SGL
data based on the hypothetical observations of the Hydrogen Intensity and
Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX), the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the
Einstein Telescope (ET), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST),
respectively. We find that the four probes show obviously different parameter
degeneracy orientations in cosmological constraints, so any combination of them
can break the parameter degeneracies and thus significantly improve the
constraint precision. The joint 21 cm IM+FRB+GW+SGL data can provide the
constraint errors of $\sigma(\Omega_{\rm m})=0.0022$ and $\sigma(H_0)=0.16\ \rm
km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, which meet the standard of
precision cosmology, i.e., the constraint precision of parameters is better
than 1%. In addition, the joint data give $\sigma(w)=0.020$ in the $w$CDM
model, and $\sigma(w_0)=0.066$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.25$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model,
which are all better than the constraints obtained by the CMB+BAO+SN data. We
show that the synergy between the four late-universe cosmological probes has
magnificent prospects.

For future surveys of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we clarify information
available from cosmic dispersion measures (DMs) through cross-correlation
analyses of foreground dark matter haloes (hosting galaxies and galaxy
clusters) with their known redshifts. With a halo-model approach, we predict
that the cross-correlation with cluster-sized haloes is less affected by the
details of gastrophysics, providing robust cosmological information. For less
massive haloes, the cross-correlation at angular scales of $<10\,
\mathrm{arcmin}$ is sensitive to gas expelled from the halo centre due to
galactic feedback. Assuming $20000$ FRBs over $20000 \, {\rm deg}^2$ with a
localisation error being 3 arcmin, we expect that the cross-correlation signal
at halo masses of $10^{12}-10^{14}\, M_\odot$ can be measured with a level of
$\sim 1\%$ precision in a redshift range of $0<z<1$. Such precise measurements
enable one to put a 1.5\% level constraint on $\sigma_8\,
(\Omega_\mathrm{M}/0.3)^{0.5}$ and a 3\% level constraint on
$(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/0.049)(h/0.67)(f_\mathrm{e}/0.95)$ ($\sigma_8$,
$\Omega_\mathrm{M}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$, $h$ and $f_\mathrm{e}$ are the linear
mass variance smoothed at $8\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, mean mass density, mean
baryon density, the present-day Hubble parameter and fraction of free electrons
in cosmic baryons today), whereas the gas-to-halo mass relation in galaxies and
clusters can be constrained with a level of $10\%-20\%$. Furthermore the
cross-correlation analyses can break the degeneracy among $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$,
$h$ and $f_\mathrm{e}$, inherent in the DM-redshift relation. Our proposal
opens new possibilities for FRB cosmology, while it requires extensive galaxy
redshift catalogues and further improvement of the halo model.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients of extraordinary
luminosity. Studying the diverse temporal and spectral behaviour recently
observed in a number of FRBs may help determine the nature of the entire class.
For example, a fast spinning or highly magnetised neutron star might generate
the rotation-powered acceleration required to explain the bright emission.
Periodic, sub-second components, suggesting such rotation, were recently
reported in one FRB, and potentially in two more. Here we report the discovery
of FRB 20201020A with Apertif, an FRB showing five components regularly spaced
by 0.415 ms. This sub-millisecond structure in FRB 20201020A carries important
clues about the progenitor of this FRB specifically, and potentially about that
of FRBs in general. We thus contrast its features to the predictions of the
main FRB source models. We perform a timing analysis of the FRB 20201020A
components to determine the significance of the periodicity. We compare these
against the timing properties of the previously reported CHIME FRBs with
sub-second quasi-periodic components, and against two Apertif bursts from
repeating FRB 20180916B that show complex time-frequency structure. We find the
periodicity of FRB 20201020A to be marginally significant at 2.5$\sigma$. Its
repeating subcomponents cannot be explained as a pulsar rotation since the
required spin rate of over 2 kHz exceeds the limits set by typical neutron star
equations of state and observations. The fast periodicity is also in conflict
with a compact object merger scenario. These quasi-periodic components could,
however, be caused by equidistant emitting regions in the magnetosphere of a
magnetar. The sub-millisecond spacing of the components in FRB 20201020A, the
smallest observed so far in a one-off FRB, may rule out both neutron-star
rotation and binary mergers as the direct source of quasi-periodic FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09858v3
We consider a magnetar flare model for fast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that
millisecond burst of sufficient power can be generated by synchrotron maser
emission ignited at the reverse shock propagating through the weakly magnetized
material that forms the magnetar flare. If the maser emission is generated in
an anisotropic regime (due to the geometry of the production region or presence
of an intense external source of stimulating photons) the duration of the maser
flashes is similar to the magnetar flare duration even if the shock front
radius is large. Our scenario allows relaxing the requirements for several key
parameters: the magnetic field strength at the production site, luminosity of
the flare, and the production site bulk Lorentz factor. To check the
feasibility of this model, we study the statistical relation between powerful
magnetar flares and the rate of FRBs. The expected ratio is derived by
convoluting the redshift-dependent magnetar density with their flare luminosity
function above the energy limit determined by the FRB detection threshold. We
obtain that only a small fraction, $\sim10^{-5}$, of powerful magnetar flares
trigger FRBs. This ratio agrees surprisingly well with our estimates: we
obtained that $10\%$ of magnetars should be in the evolutionary phase suitable
for the production of FRBs, and only $10^{-4}$ of all flares are expected to be
weakly magnetized, which is a necessary condition for the high-frequency maser
emission.

We present 849 new bursts from FRB 20121102A detected with the 305-m Arecibo
Telescope. Observations were conducted as part of our regular campaign to
monitor the activity and evolution of burst properties. The 10 reported
observations were carried out between 1150 and 1730 MHz and fall in the active
period around November 2018. All bursts were dedispersed at the same dispersion
measure and are consistent with a single value of 562.4(1) pc/cm$^3$. The burst
rate varies between 0 bursts and 218(16) bursts per hour, the highest rate
observed to date. The times between consecutive bursts show a bimodal
distribution. We find that arrival times with separations > 0.1 s are best
described as a Poisson process with varying rate, compared to models with
additional parameters. Clustering on time-scales of 22 ms is reflecting a
characteristic time-scale of the source and possibly the emission mechanism. We
analyse the spectro-temporal structure of the bursts by fitting 2D Gaussians
with a temporal drift to each sub-burst in the dynamic spectra. We find a
linear relationship between the sub-burst's drift and its duration. At the same
time the drifts are consistent with coming from the sad-trombone effect. This
has not been predicted by current models. The energy distribution shows an
excess of high energy bursts and is insufficiently modeled by a single
power-law even within single observations. We find long-term changes in the
energy distribution and the average spectrum compared to earlier and later
published observations. Finally, despite the large burst rate we find no strict
short-term periodicity.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04422v2
To probe this question, we perform a statistical analysis using the first
Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB)
catalog and identify a few discriminant properties between repeating and
non-repeating FRBs such as the repetition rate, duration, bandwidth, spectral
index, peak luminosity, and potential peak frequency. If repeating and
non-repeating FRBs belong to one population, their distribution distinctions
for the repetition rate and duration can be explained by the selection effect
due to the beamed emission as in Connor et al. (2020). However, we obtain that
the distribution distinctions for the spectral index and potentially the peak
frequency cannot be explained by the beamed emission within the framework of
either the coherent curvature radiation or synchrotron maser emission. This
indicates that there could be two populations. We further discuss three
possible scenarios for the required two populations.

Boasting supreme magnetic strengths, magnetars are among the prime candidates
to generate fast radio bursts. Several theories have been proposed for the
formation mechanism of magnetars, but have not yet been fully tested. As
different magnetar formation theories expect distinct magnetar space velocity
distributions, high-precision astrometry of Galactic magnetars can serve as a
probe for the formation theories. In addition, magnetar astrometry can refine
the understanding of the distribution of Galactic magnetars. This distribution
can be compared against fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized in spiral galaxies,
in order to test the link between FRBs and magnetars. Swift J1818.0-1607 is the
hitherto fastest-spinning magnetar and the fifth discovered radio magnetar. In
an ongoing astrometric campaign, we have observed Swift J1818.0-1607 for one
year using the Very Long Baseline Array, and have determined a precise proper
motion as well as a tentative parallax for the magnetar.

Recently, about five hundred fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by CHIME/FRB
Project have been reported. The vast amounts of data would make FRBs a
promising low-redshift cosmological probe in the forthcoming years, and thus
the issue of how many FRBs are needed for precise cosmological parameter
estimation in different dark energy models should be detailedly investigated.
Different from the usually considered $w(z)$-parameterized models in the
literature, in this work we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model
and the Ricci dark energy (RDE) model, which originate from the holographic
principle of quantum gravity, using the simulated localized FRB data as a
cosmological probe for the first time. We show that the Hubble constant $H_0$
can be constrained to about 2% precision in the HDE model with the Macquart
relation of FRB by using 10000 accurately-localized FRBs combined with the
current CMB data, which is similar to the precision of the SH0ES value. Using
10000 localized FRBs combined with the CMB data can achieve about 6% constraint
on the dark-energy parameter $c$ in the HDE model, which is tighter than the
current BAO data combined with CMB. We also study the combination of the FRB
data and another low-redshift cosmological probe, i.e. gravitational wave (GW)
standard siren data, with the purpose of measuring cosmological parameters
independent of CMB. Although the parameter degeneracies inherent in FRB and in
GW are rather different, we find that more than 10000 FRBs are demanded to
effectively improve the constraints in the holographic dark energy models.

The possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) form a part of dark matter
has been considered for a long time but poorly constrained over a wide mass
range. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond
duration. Lensing effect of them has been proposed as one of the cleanest
probes for constraining the presence of PBHs in the stellar mass window. In
this paper, we first apply the normalised cross-correlation algorithm to search
and identify candidates of lensed FRBs in the latest public FRB observations,
i.e. $593$ FRBs which mainly consist of the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment FRB catalog, and then derive constraints on the abundance of
PBHs from the null search result of lensing signature. For a monochromatic mass
distribution, the fraction of dark matter made up of PBHs could be constrained
to $\leq87\%$ for $\geq500~M_{\odot}$ at 95\% confidence level by assuming flux
ratio thresholds dependent signal-to-noise ratio for each FRB and that
apparently one-off events are intrinsic single bursts. This result would be
improved by a three times factor when a conventional constant flux ratio
threshold is considered. Moreover, we derive constraints on PBHs with a
log-normal mass function naturally predicted by some popular inflation models
and often investigated with gravitational wave detections. We find that, in
this mass distribution scenario, the constraint from currently public FRB
observations is relatively weaker than the one from gravitational wave
detections. It is foreseen that upcoming complementary multi-messenger
observations will yield considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs
in this intriguing mass window.

We present a novel model that explains the origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
-- short ($<1~\rm{s}$), bright ($0.1 - 1000~\rm{Jy}$) bursts of GHz frequency
radio waves. The model has three ingredients -- compact object, progenitor with
effective magnetic field strength around $10^{10}~{\rm Gauss}$, and GHz
frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The energy conversion from GWs to
electromagnetic waves occurs when GWs pass through the magnetosphere of such
compact objects due to the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich effect. This conversion
produces bursts of electromagnetic waves in the GHz range, leading to FRBs. Our
model has three key features: (i) can generate peak-flux up to $1000~{\rm Jy}$,
(ii) can naturally explain the pulse-width and (iii) predict FRB's random and
repeating nature with a wide flux range. We thus conclude that the millisecond
pulsars could be the progenitor of FRBs. Further, our model offers a novel
perspective on the indirection detection of GWs at high-frequency beyond
detection capabilities. Thus, transient events like FRBs are a rich source for
the current era of multi-messenger astronomy.

The INTEGRAL satellite, in orbit since October 2002, has significantly
contributed to the study of magnetars and, thanks to its unique capabilities
for the study of transient gamma-ray phenomena, it is now playing an important
role in multimessenger astrophysics. The most recent results include the
discovery of a peculiar burst from SGR J1935+2154, which gave the first
observational evidence for the connection between magnetars and fast radio
bursts, and extensive searches for bursting activity in peculiar sources, such
as the repeating FRB 20200120E in M81 and the ultra-long period magnetar
candidate GLEAMX J162759.5--523504.3.

Magnetars are the most promising progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).
Strong radio waves propagating through the magnetar wind are subject to
non-linear effects, including modulation/filamentation instabilities. We derive
the dispersion relation for modulations of strong waves propagating in
magnetically-dominated pair plasmas focusing on dimensionless strength
parameters $a_0\lesssim 1$, and discuss implications for FRBs. As an effect of
the instability, the FRB radiation intensity develops sheets perpendicular to
the direction of the wind magnetic field. When the FRB front expands outside
the radius where the instability ends, the radiation sheets are scattered due
to diffraction. The FRB scattering timescale depends on the properties of the
magnetar wind. In a cold wind, the typical scattering timescale is $\tau_{\rm
sc}\sim{\rm\; \mu s-ms}$ at the frequency $\nu\sim 1{\rm\; GHz}$. The
scattering timescale increases at low frequencies, with the scaling $\tau_{\rm
sc}\propto\nu^{-2}$. The frequency-dependent broadening of the brightest pulse
of FRB 181112 is consistent with this scaling. From the scattering timescale of
the pulse, one can estimate that the wind Lorentz factor is larger than a few
tens. In a warm wind, the scattering timescale can approach $\tau_{\rm
sc}\sim{\rm\; ns}$. Then scattering produces a frequency modulation of the
observed intensity with a large bandwidth, $\Delta\nu\sim 1/\tau_{\rm
sc}\gtrsim 100{\rm\; MHz}$. Broadband frequency modulations observed in FRBs
could be due to scattering in a warm magnetar wind.

The dispersion measures (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the
integrated electron density along the line-of-sight, which is typically
dominated by the intergalactic medium (IGM) contribution in the case of
extragalactic FRBs. In this paper, we show that incorporating wide-field
spectroscopic galaxy survey data in the foreground of localized FRBs can
significantly improve constraints on the partition of diffuse cosmic baryons.
Using mock DMs and realistic lightcone galaxy catalogs derived from the
Millennium simulation, we define spectroscopic surveys that can be carried out
with 4m and 8m-class wide field spectroscopic facilities. On these simulated
surveys, we carry out Bayesian density reconstructions in order to estimate the
foreground matter density field. In comparison with the `true' matter density
field, we show that these can help reduce the uncertainties in the foreground
structures by $\sim 2-3\times$ compared to cosmic variance. We calculate the
Fisher matrix to forecast that $N=30\: (96)$ localized FRBs should be able to
constrain the diffuse cosmic baryon fraction to $\sim 10\%\: (\sim 5\%) $, and
parameters governing the size and baryon fraction of galaxy circumgalactic
halos to within $\sim 20-25\%\: (\sim 8-12\%)$. From the Fisher analysis, we
show that the foreground data increases the sensitivity of localized FRBs
toward our parameters of interest by $\sim 25\times$. We briefly introduce
FLIMFLAM, an ongoing galaxy redshift survey that aims to obtain foreground data
on $\sim 30$ localized FRB fields.

Extremely bright coherent radio bursts with millisecond duration, reminiscent
of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs), were co-detected with
anomalously-hard X-ray bursts from a Galactic magnetar SGR 1935$+$2154. We
investigate the possibility that the event was triggered by the magnetic energy
injection inside the magnetosphere, thereby producing magnetically-trapped
fireball (FB) and relativistic outflows simultaneously. The thermal component
of the X-ray burst is consistent with a trapped FB with an average temperature
of $\sim200$-$300$ keV and size of $\sim10^5$ cm. Meanwhile, the non-thermal
component of the X-ray burst and the coherent radio burst may arise from
relativistic outflows. We calculate the dynamical evolution of the outflow,
launched with an energy budget of $10^{39}$-$10^{40}$ erg comparable to that
for the trapped FB, for different initial baryon load $\eta$ and magnetization
$\sigma_0$. If hard X-ray and radio bursts are both produced by the energy
dissipation of the outflow, the outflow properties are constrained by combining
the conditions for photon escape and the intrinsic timing offset $\lesssim10$
ms among radio and X-ray burst spikes. We show that the hard X-ray burst must
be generated at $r_{\rm X}\gtrsim10^{8}$ cm from the magnetar, irrespective of
the emission mechanism. Moreover, we find that the outflow quickly accelerates
up to a Lorentz factor of $10^2\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim10^3$ by the time it
reaches the edge of the magnetosphere and the dissipation occurs at $10^{12}$
cm $\lesssim r_{\rm radio,X}\lesssim10^{14}$ cm. Our results imply either
extremely-clean ($\eta\gtrsim10^4$) or highly-magnetized
($\sigma_0\gtrsim10^3$) outflows, which might be consistent with the rarity of
the phenomenon.

The radiation of a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) reflects from the Moon and Sun. If
a reflection is detected, the time interval between the direct and reflected
signals constrains the source to a narrow arc on the sky. If both Lunar and
Solar reflections are detected these two arcs intersect, narrowly confining the
source location on the sky. Galactic FRB like FRB 200428 may be bright enough
to be detected by a 25 m diameter radio telescope staring at the Moon or Sun. A
previous paper calculated reflection by the Moon. Here we calculate the
reflectivity of the Sun in the "flat Sun" approximation as a function of angle
of incidence and frequency. At grazing incidence the reflectivity is high at
frequencies $\lessapprox 200\,$MHz but low at higher frequencies; for
near-normal incidence the reflectivity is high only for frequencies
$\lessapprox 100\,$MHz.

Currently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a very active field in
astronomy and cosmology. However, the origin of FRBs is still unknown to date.
The studies on the intrinsic FRB distributions might help us to reveal the
possible origins of FRBs, and improve the simulations for FRB cosmology.
Recently, the first CHIME/FRB catalog of 536 events was released. Such a large
uniform sample of FRBs detected by a single telescope is very valuable to test
the FRB distributions. Later, it has been claimed that the FRB distribution
model tracking the cosmic star formation history (SFH) was rejected by the
first CHIME/FRB catalog. In the present work, we consider some empirical FRB
distribution models, and find that many of them can be fully consistent with
the CHIME/FRB observational data for some suitable model parameters. Notice
that a suppressed evolution with respect to SFH is commonly found for FRBs. In
particular, we independently confirm that the FRB distribution model tracking
SFH can be rejected at very high confidence. On the other hand, all the
``successful'' models effectively require a certain degree of ``delay'' with
respect to SFH. These results might shed light on the origin of FRBs and FRB
cosmology.

Since the discovery of the first fast radio burst (FRB) in 2007, and their
confirmation as an abundant extragalactic population in 2013, the study of
these sources has expanded at an incredible rate. In our 2019 review on the
subject we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs -- 60
unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However,
in only a few short years new observations and discoveries have given us a
wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands
at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time
resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given
us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity,
progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent
detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935+2154
provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to
be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters
and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster
associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting
observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact
on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We
build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on
recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field
enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered
and reported each year.

The redshift distribution of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is not well
constrained. The association of the Galactic FRB 200428 with the young magnetar
SGR 1935+2154 raises the working hypothesis that FRB sources track the star
formation history of the universe. The discovery of FRB 20200120E in
association with a globular cluster in the nearby galaxy M81, however, casts
doubts on such an assumption. We apply the Monte Carlo method developed in a
previous work to test different FRB redshift distribution models against the
recently released first CHIME FRB catalog in terms of their distributions in
specific fluence, external dispersion measure ($\rm DM_E$), and inferred
isotropic energy. Our results clearly rule out the hypothesis that all FRBs
track the star formation history of the universe. The hypothesis that all FRBs
track the accumulated stars throughout history describes the data better but
still cannot meet both the $\rm DM_E$ and the energy criteria. The data seem to
be better modeled with either a redshift distribution model invoking a
significant delay with respect to star formation or a hybrid model invoking
both a dominant delayed population and a subdominant star formation population.
We discuss the implications of this finding for FRB source models.

We report a Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm mapping study of the
neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the host galaxy of the fast radio burst (FRB)
FRB20180916B at $z \approx 0.03399$. We find that the FRB host has an HI mass
of $\rm M_{HI} = (2.74 \pm 0.33) \times 10^9 \ M_\odot$ and a high
HI-to-stellar mass ratio, $\approx 1.3$. The FRB host is thus a gas-rich but
near-quiescent galaxy, that is likely to have acquired a significant mass of HI
in the recent past. The HI distribution is disturbed, with extended HI 21cm
emission detected in a north-eastern tail, a counter-tail towards the south, an
HI hole between the galaxy centre and the FRB location, and a high HI column
density measured close to the FRB position. The FRB host is part of a group
with four companions detected in their HI 21cm emission, the nearest of which
is only 22~kpc from the FRB location. The gas-richness and disturbed HI
distribution indicate that the FRB host has recently undergone a minor merger,
which increased its HI mass, disturbed the HI in the galaxy disk, and
compressed the HI near the FRB location to increase its surface density. We
propose that this merger caused the burst of star-formation in the outskirts of
the galaxy that gave rise to the FRB progenitor. The evidence for a minor
merger is consistent with scenarios in which the FRB progenitor is a massive
star, formed due to the merger event.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) has been considered to form a part of dark
matter for a long time but the possibility has been poorly constrained over a
wide mass range, including the stellar mass range ($1-100~M_{\odot}$). However,
due to the discovery of merger events of black hole binaries by LIGO-Virgo
gravitational wave observatories, the interest for PBHs in the stellar mass
window has been aroused again. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio
transients with millisecond duration and very high all-sky occurrence rate.
Lensing effect of these bursts has been proposed as one of the optimal probes
for constraining the abundance of PBHs in the stellar mass range. In this
paper, we first investigate constraints on the abundance of PBHs from the
latest $593$ FRB observations for both the monochromatic mass distribution and
three other popular extended mass distributions related to different formation
mechanisms of PBHs. It is found that constraints from currently public FRB
observations are relatively weaker than those from existing gravitational wave
detections. Furthermore, we forecast constraining power of future FRB
observations on the abundance of PBHs with different mass distributions of PBHs
and different redshift distributions of FRBs taken into account. Finally, We
find that constraints of parameter space on extended mass distributions from
$\sim10^5$ FRBs with $\overline{\Delta t}\leq1 ~\rm ms$ would be comparable
with what can be constrained from gravitational wave events. It is foreseen
that upcoming complementary multi-messenger observations will yield
considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs in this intriguing mass
window.

The CHIME/FRB experiment has detected thousands of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
due to its sensitivity and wide field of view; however, its low angular
resolution prevents it from localizing events to their host galaxies. Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), triggered by FRB detections from CHIME/FRB will
solve the challenge of localization for non-repeating events. Using a
refurbished 10-m radio dish at the Algonquin Radio Observatory located in
Ontario Canada, we developed a testbed for a VLBI experiment with a theoretical
~<30 masec precision. We provide an overview of the 10-m system and describe
its refurbishment, the data acquisition, and a procedure for fringe fitting
that simultaneously estimates the geometric delay used for localization and the
dispersive delay from the ionosphere. Using single pulses from the Crab pulsar,
we validate the system and localization procedure, and analyze the clock
stability between sites, which is critical for phase-referencing an FRB event.
We find a localization of 50 masec is possible with the performance of the
current system. Furthermore, for sources with insufficient signal or restricted
wideband to simultaneously measure both geometric and ionospheric delays, we
show that the differential ionospheric contribution between the two sites must
be measured to a precision of 1e-8 pc/cc to provide a reasonable localization
from a detection in the 400--800 MHz band. Finally we show detection of an FRB
observed simultaneously in the CHIME and the Algonquin 10-m telescope, the
first FRB cross-correlated in this very long baseline. This project serves as a
testbed for the forthcoming CHIME/FRB Outriggers project.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most interesting nonparticle
dark matter (DM) candidates. They may explain all the DM content in the
Universe in the mass regime from about $10^{-14}M_{\odot}$ to
$10^{-11}M_{\odot}$. We study PBHs as the source of fast radio bursts (FRBs)
via magnetic reconnection in the event of collisions between them and neutron
stars (NSs) in galaxies. We investigate the energy loss of PBHs during PBH-NS
encounters to model their capture by NSs. To an order-of-magnitude estimation,
we conclude that the parameter space of PBHs being all DM is accidentally
consistent with that to produce FRBs with a rate which is the order of the
observed FRB rate.

Fast radio burst (FRB) 191001 is localised at the spiral arm of a highly
star-forming galaxy with an observed dispersion measure (DM) of 507 pc
cm$^{-3}$. Subtracting the contributions of the intergalactic medium and our
Milky Way Galaxy from the total DM, one gets an excess of around 200 pc
cm$^{-3}$, which may have been contributed by the host galaxy of the FRB. It is
found in this work that the position of FRB 191001 is consistent with the
distribution of supernovae (SNe) in the spiral arm of their parent galaxies. If
this event is indeed due to an SN explosion, then, from the analysis of the SN
contributions to the excess DM, a core-collapse (CC) channel is preferred over
a thermonuclear runaway. For the CC explosion, depending on the density of the
surrounding medium, the age of the central engine that powers the radio burst
is within a couple of years to a few decades. However, the observed rotation
measure of FRB 191001 does not confirm the fact that the radio burst has passed
through the remnant of a young SN.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond pulses in radio, most of
which originate from distant galaxies. Revealing the origin of FRBs is becoming
central in astronomy. The redshift evolution of the FRB energy function, i.e.,
the number density of FRB sources as a function of energy, provides important
implications for the FRB progenitors. Here we show the energy functions of FRBs
selected from the recently released Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) catalogue using the $V_{\rm max}$ method. The $V_{\rm max}$
method allows us to measure the redshift evolution of the energy functions as
it is without any prior assumption on the evolution. We use a homogeneous
sample of 164 non-repeating FRB sources, which are about one order of magnitude
larger than previously investigated samples. The energy functions of
non-repeating FRBs show Schechter function-like shapes at $z\lesssim1$. The
energy functions and volumetric rates of non-repeating FRBs decrease towards
higher redshifts similar to the cosmic stellar-mass density evolution: there is
no significant difference between the non-repeating FRB rate and cosmic
stellar-mass density evolution with a 1\% significance threshold, whereas the
cosmic star-formation rate scenario is rejected with a more than 99\%
confidence level. Our results indicate that the event rate of non-repeating
FRBs is likely controlled by old populations rather than young populations
which are traced by the cosmic star-formation rate density. This suggests old
populations such as old neutron stars and black holes as more likely
progenitors of non-repeating FRBs.

A major limitation of fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems is their failure to deal
with high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of
T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus,
there are hardly any work dealing with datasets with dimensions more than
hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle
datasets with dimensions even more than 7000! In this context, we propose an
adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of
``numeric underflow" and ``fake minimum" that arise for existing fuzzy systems
while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an Adaptive
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to
perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this
context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the
consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two
successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design
an enhanced fuzzy rule base (En-FRB), which maintains adequate rules but does
not grow the number of rules exponentially with dimension that typically
happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated Feature Selection and Rule
Extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: (i)
feature selection, (ii) rule extraction, and (iii) fine tuning. The
effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five
are in more than 2000 dimension including two with dimension greater than 7000.
This may be the first time fuzzy systems are realized for classification
involving more than 7000 input features.

We present a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis study of fast radio burst
(FRB) dispersion and scattering focusing on the first catalog of sources
detected with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio
Burst (CHIME/FRB) project. We simulate intrinsic properties and propagation
effects for a variety of FRB population models and compare the simulated
distributions of dispersion measures (DMs) and scattering timescales with the
corresponding distributions from the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our simulations confirm
the results of previous population studies, which suggested that the
interstellar medium of the host galaxy alone (simulated based on the NE2001
model) cannot explain the observed scattering timescales of FRBs. We therefore
consider additional sources of scattering, namely, the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) of intervening galaxies and the circumburst medium whose properties are
modeled based on typical Galactic plane environments. We find that a population
of FRBs with scattering contributed by these media is marginally consistent
with the CHIME/FRB catalog. In this scenario, our simulations favor a
population of FRBs offset from their galaxy centers over a population which is
distributed along the spiral arms. However, if the models proposing the CGM as
a source of intense scattering are incorrect, then we conclude that FRBs may
inhabit environments with more extreme properties than those inferred for
pulsars in the Milky Way.

Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic shocks are efficient particle accelerators,
often invoked in the models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and shock-powered fast
radio bursts (FRBs). Most theoretical studies assume a perpendicular shock with
an ordered magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal. However, the
degree of magnetization $\sigma$ and the magnetic field geometry in
shock-powered GRB/FRB scenarios are still poorly constrained by observations.
Analogous to the magnetization $\sigma$ associated with the total field
strength, we define a tangential magnetization $\sigma_\perp$ associated with
the tangential field component. We explore the jump conditions of magnetized
relativistic shocks, either with an ordered field of arbitrary inclination
angle or with a random field of arbitrary anisotropy. In either case, we find
that the jump conditions of relativistic shocks are governed by the tangential
magnetization $\sigma_\perp$ instead of the total magnetization $\sigma$,
insensitive to the inclination angles or the anisotropy of the pre-shock
magnetic field. The approximated analytical solution developed in this work
could serve as a quick check for numerical simulations and apply to theoretical
studies of GRBs/FRBs with a more general field geometry.

The detection of a bright radio burst (hereafter FRB 200428) in association
with a hard X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 suggests that
magnetars can make FRBs. We study possible neutrino emission from FRB-emitting
magnetars by developing a general theoretical framework. We consider three
different sites for proton acceleration and neutrino emission, i.e. within the
magnetosphere, in the current sheet region beyond the light cylinder, and in
relativistic shocks far away from the magnetosphere. Different cooling
processes for protons and pions are considered to calculate the neutrino
emission suppression factor within each scenario. We find that the flux of the
neutrino emission decreases with increasing radius from the magnetar due to the
decrease of the target photon number density. We calculate the neutrino flux
from FRB 200428 and its associated X-ray burst. The flux of the most optimistic
case invoking magnetospheric proton acceleration is still $\sim4$ orders of
magnitude below the IceCube sensitivity. We also estimate the diffuse neutrino
background from all FRB-emitting magnetars in the universe. The total neutrino
flux of magnetars during their FRB emission phases is a negligible fraction of
observed diffuse emission even under the most optimistic magnetospheric
scenario for neutrino emission. However, if one assumes that many more X-ray
bursts without FRB associations can also produce neutrinos with similar
mechanisms, magnetars can contribute up to $10^{-8} \ {\rm GeV \ s^{-1} \
sr^{-1} \ cm^{-2}}$ diffuse neutrino background flux in the GeV to multi-TeV
range.

FRB 121102 is the first fast radio burst source to be spatially associated
with a persistent radio source (QRS121102), the nature of which remains
unknown. We present a detailed observational study of QRS121102 and its host
galaxy. We constrain the physical size of QRS121102 by measuring its
flux-density variability with the VLA in the Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz) and the
K-band (18 to 26 GHz). Any such variability would likely be due to Galactic
refractive scintillation and would require the source radius to be <10^17 cm at
the host-galaxy redshift. We found the radio variability to be lower than the
scintillation theory predictions for such a small source, leaving open the
possibility for non-AGN models for QRS121102. In addition, we roughly estimated
the mass of any potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) associated with
QRS121102 from the width of the H\alpha emission line using a medium-resolution
optical spectrum from the Keck Observatory. The line width gives a velocity
dispersion of <30 km/s, indicating a SMBH mass of <10^{4~5} M_sun. We find the
SMBH mass too low for the observed radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity
constraints, if QRS121102 were an AGN. Finally, some dwarf galaxies that host
SMBH may be the stripped cores of massive galaxies during the tidal
interactions with companion systems. We find no nearby galaxy at the same
redshift as the QRS121102 host from low-resolution Keck spectra, or from the
PanSTARRS catalog. In conclusion, we find no evidence supporting the hypothesis
that the persistent radio source associated with FRB 121102 is an AGN. We
instead argue that the inferred size, and the flat radio spectrum, favors a
plerion interpretation. We urge continued broadband radio monitoring of
QRS121102 to search for long-term evolution, and the detailed evaluation of
potential analogs that may provide greater insight into the nature of this
class of object.

We report on a search for persistent radio emission from the one-off Fast
Radio Burst (FRB) 20190714A, as well as from two repeating FRBs, 20190711A and
20171019A, using the MeerKAT radio telescope. For FRB 20171019A we also
conducted simultaneous observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S.) in very high energy gamma rays and searched for signals in the
ultraviolet, optical, and X-ray bands. For this FRB, we obtain a UV flux upper
limit of 1.39x10^-16 erg/cm^-2/s/Amstrong, X-ray limit of ~ 6.6x10^-14
erg/cm^-2/s and a limit on the very-high-energy gamma-ray flux (Phi) (E > 120
GeV) < 1.7 x 10^-12 erg/cm^-2/s. We obtain a radio upper limit of ~15
microJy/beam for persistent emission at the locations of both FRBs 20190711A
and 20171019A, but detect diffuse radio emission with a peak brightness of ~53
microJy/beam associated with FRB 20190714A at z = 0.2365. This represents the
first detection of the radio continuum emission potentially associated with the
host (galaxy) of FRB 20190714A, and is only the third known FRB to have such an
association. Given the possible association of a faint persistent source, FRB
20190714A may potentially be a repeating FRB whose age lies between that of FRB
20121102A and FRB 20180916A. A parallel search for repeat bursts from these
FRBs revealed no new detections down to a fluence of 0.08 Jy ms for a 1 ms
duration burst.

Neutron tunneling in neutron star crusts can release enormous amounts of
energy on a short timescale. We have clarified aspects of this process
occurring in the outer crust regions of neutron stars when oscillations or
cataclysmic events changes the crustal ambient density. We report a
time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model to determine the rate of neutron
diffusion and conclude that a large amount of energy, in the range of 10^40 -
10^44 erg, can be released rapidly. We suggest that this mechanism may be the
source of hitherto unknown phenomena such as the Fast Radio Bursts (FRBS).

We describe how the observed polarization properties of an astronomical
object are related to its intrinsic polarization properties and the finite
temporal and spectral resolutions of the observing device. Moreover, we discuss
the effect that a scattering screen, with non-zero magnetic field, between the
source and observer has on the observed polarization properties. We show that
the polarization properties are determined by the ratio of observing bandwidth
and coherence bandwidth of the scattering screen and the ratio of temporal
resolution of the instrument and the variability time of screen, as long as the
length over which the Faraday rotation induced by the screen changes by
$\sim\pi$ is smaller than the size of the screen visible to the observer. We
describe the conditions under which a source that is 100\% linearly polarized
intrinsically might be observed as partially depolarized, and how the source's
temporal variability can be distinguished from the temporal variability induced
by the scattering screen. In general, linearly polarized waves passing through
a magnetized scattering screen can develop a significant circular polarization.
We apply the work to the observed polarization properties of a few fast radio
bursts (FRBs), and outline potential applications to pulsars.

Despite numerous studies, the sources of IceCube cosmic neutrinos have
hitherto been unidentified. Utilizing recently released IceCube neutrino and
CHIME FRB catalogs, we examine the possibility of an association between
neutrinos and FRBs for both the entire FRB population and individual FRBs using
the directional matching method. We report an association between FRBs and
low-energy IceCube neutrinos with energies 0.1 -- 3 TeV at a significance level
of $21.3 \sigma$. We also identify 20 FRBs that are candidate association
sources of neutrinos, all of which are apparently non-repeating FRBs. This
sub-sample of FRBs shows no special properties compared with the whole CHIME
FRB sample. We discuss the possible physical origin of such associations within
the framework of the magnetar models of FRBs.

In a recent work (arXiv:2112.11375), Luo and Zhang have asserted that there
is a statistically significant angular correlation between IceCube neutrinos
(in the energy range of 0.1-3 TeV) and FRBs detected by the CHIME telescope,
with 21$\sigma$ significance. We independently verify this claim by counting
the total number of neutrino-FRB pairs with angular separations of $< 3 $
degrees, as well as within the observed neutrino error circle, which correspond
to the total signal events. This number is then compared to the background,
which was obtained by counting the number of coincidences in off-source angular
windows with the same solid angle as the signal window. We do not find any
statistically significant excess compared to the background. Therefore, we
conclude that there is no evidence for an angular correlation between the
IceCube neutrinos in the TeV energy range and CHIME FRBs.

We study the statistical properties of the soft gamma repeater SGR 1935+2154.
We find that the cumulative distributions of duration, waiting time, fluence
and flux can be well fitted by bent power law. In addition, the probability
density functions of fluctuations of duration, waiting time, fluence and flux
well follow the Tsallis $q$-Gaussian distribution. The $q$ values keep steady
for different temporal scale intervals, indicating a scale-invariant structure
of the bursts. Those features are very similar to the property of the repeating
fast radio burst FRB 121102, indicating the underlying association between the
origins of soft gamma repeaters and repeating fast radio bursts.

The total event number of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is accumulating rapidly
with the improvement of existing radio telescopes and the completion of new
facilities. Especially, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio
Telescope (FAST) Collaboration has just reported more than one thousand bursts
in a short observing period of 47 days \citep{LiD2021}. The interesting bimodal
distribution in their work motivates us to revisit the definition of FRBs. In
this work, we ascribe the bimodal distribution to two physical kinds of radio
bursts, which may have different radiation mechanisms. We propose to use
brightness temperature to separate two subtypes. For FRB 20121102A, the
critical brightness temperature is $T_{\rm B,cri}\simeq10^{33}\,\rm K$. Bursts
with $T_{\rm B}\geq T_{\rm B,cri}$ are denoted as "classical" FRBs, and further
we find a tight pulse width-fluence relation
($T\propto\mathcal{F_\nu}^{0.306}$) for them. On the contrary, the other bursts
are considered as "atypical" bursts that may originate from a different
physical process. We suggest that for each FRB event, a similar dividing line
should exist but $T_{\rm B,cri}$ is not necessarily the same. Its exact value
depends on FRB radiation mechanism and properties of the source.

We present the largest and deepest late-time radio and millimeter survey to
date of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts
(LGRBs) to search for associated non-thermal synchrotron emission. Using the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we observed 43 sources at 6 and 100 GHz
on a timescale of $\sim 1 - 19$ yr post-explosion. We do not detect radio/mm
emission from any of the sources, with the exception of a 6 GHz detection of
PTF10hgi (Eftekhari et al. 2019), as well as the detection of 6 GHz emission
near the location of the SLSN PTF12dam, which we associate with its host
galaxy. We use our data to place constraints on central engine emission due to
magnetar wind nebulae and off-axis relativistic jets. We also explore
non-relativistic emission from the SN ejecta, and place constraints on obscured
star formation in the host galaxies. In addition, we conduct a search for fast
radio bursts (FRBs) from some of the sources using VLA Phased-Array
observations; no FRBs are detected to a limit of $16$ mJy ($7\sigma$; 10 ms
duration) in about 40 min on source per event. A comparison to theoretical
models suggests that continued radio monitoring may lead to detections of
persistent radio emission on timescales of $\gtrsim {\rm decade}$.

We propose a new model for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) based on a sudden
discharge of a charged young magnetar, caused by the short falling timescale of
oppositely charged particles onto the magnetar. In this scenario, curvature
radiation is emitted by particles accelerated at relativistic by the strong
electric fields produced by the disconnection and the subsequent reconnection
of the magnetic field lines, a process triggered by the sudden discharge. We
modeled the magnetars as charged neutron stars in the static approximation
using the exterior metric by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om. We also adopted an
electrical charge distribution proportional to the mass-energy density,
although our results are not strongly sensitive to the specific star charge
distribution, only to the total charge. Our calculations show that the
discharge and emission timescales are several milliseconds, compatible with the
FRB phenomena for magnetars with a total charge of $\sim 10^{20}~\mathrm{C}$
and mass and radius in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and 10 to
45 km, respectively. Furthermore, the calculated total emitted power of a
coherent pulse is $P_{tot}\sim 10^{42-43} erg/s$, and the frequency range and
time scale are also consistent with FRBs astronomical observations. Finally, if
the magnetar does not collapse after the discharge, the existence of FRB
repeater sources can not rule out the existence of a blast repetition after the
time needed to magnetosphere recharges and produce a new discharge.

The objects that emit extragalatic fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain
unidentified. Studies of the host galaxies and environments of accurately
localised ($\lesssim1$ arcsec) FRBs promise to deliver critical insights into
the nature of their progenitors. Here we demonstrate the effects of
observational selection biases on analyses of the distributions of FRB
host-galaxy properties (including star-formation rate, SFR, and stellar mass,
$M_{*}$), and on the distributions of FRB offsets from the centres of their
hosts. We consider the effects of "radio selection", wherein FRBs with larger
dispersion measures and scattering timescales are less likely to be detected,
and the effects of "optical selection", wherein FRBs with fainter host galaxies
are more likely to have unidentified or mis-identified hosts. We develop a
plausible, illustrative model for these effects in observations of FRBs and
their host galaxies by combining the output catalogues of a semi-analytic
galaxy formation model with a recently developed algorithm to associate FRBs
with host galaxies (PATH). We find that optical selection biases are most
important for the host-galaxy $M_{*}$ and SFR distributions, and that radio
selection biases are most important for the distribution of FRB projected
physical offsets. For our fiducial simulation of FRBs at $z<0.5$, the selection
biases cause the median host-galaxy SFR to be increased by $\sim0.3$ dex, and
the median $M_{*}$ by $\sim0.5$ dex. The median projected physical offset is
increased by $\sim2$ kpc ($\sim0.25$ dex). These effects are sufficiently large
so as to merit careful consideration in studies of localised FRBs, and our
simulations provide a guide towards their mitigation.

The repeating FRB 20201124A was first discovered by CHIME/FRB in November of
2020, after which it was seen to repeat a few times over several months. It
entered a period of high activity in April of 2021, at which time several
observatories recorded tens to hundreds more bursts from the source. These
follow-up observations enabled precise localization and host galaxy
identification. In this paper, we report on the CHIME/FRB-detected bursts from
FRB 20201124A, including their best-fit morphologies, fluences, and arrival
times. The large exposure time of the CHIME/FRB telescope to the location of
this source allows us to constrain its rates of activity. We analyze the
repetition rates over different spans of time, constraining the rate prior to
discovery to $< 3.4$ day$^{-1}$ (at 3$\sigma$), and demonstrate significant
change in the event rate following initial detection. Lastly, we perform a
maximum-likelihood estimation of a power-law luminosity function, finding a
best-fit index $\alpha = -4.6 \pm 1.3 \pm 0.6$, with a break at a fluence
threshold of $F_{\rm min} \sim 16.6$~Jy~ms, consistent with the fluence
completeness limit of the observations. This index is consistent within
uncertainties with those of other repeating FRBs for which it has been
determined.

Recently, FRB 190520B with the largest extragalactic dispersion measure (DM),
was discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST). The DM excess over the intergalactic medium and Galactic contributions
is estimated as $\sim 900$ pc cm$^{-3}$, which is nearly ten times higher than
other fast radio bursts (FRBs) host galaxies. The DM decreases with the rate
$\sim0.1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ per day. It is the second FRB associated with a compact
persistent radio source (PRS). The rotation measure (RM) is found to be larger
than $1.8 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{rad} ~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. In this letter, we
argue that FRB 190520B is powered by a young magentar formed by core-collapse
of massive stars, embedded in a composite of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) and
supernova remnant (SNR). The energy injection of the magnetar drives the MWN
and SN ejecta to evolve together, and the PRS is generated by the synchrotron
radiation of the MWN. The magnetar has the interior magnetic field
$B_{\text{int}}\sim (2-4)\times 10^{16}$ G and the age $t_{\text{age}}\sim
14-22$ yr. The dense SN ejecta and the shocked shell contribute a large
fraction of the observed DM and RM. Our model can naturally explain the
luminous PRS, decreasing DM and extreme RM of FRB 190520B simultaneously.

Coherent curvature radiation as the radiation mechanism for fast radio bursts
(FRBs) has been discussed since FRBs were discovered. We study the spectral and
polarization properties of repeating FRBs within the framework of coherent
curvature radiation by charged bunches in the magnetosphere of a highly
magnetized neutron star. The spectra can be generally characterized by
multisegment broken power laws, and evolve as bunches move and the line of
sight sweeps. Emitted waves are highly linear polarized if the line of sight is
confined to the beam within an angle of $1/\gamma$, while circular polarized
degree becomes strong for off-beam cases. The spectro-temporal pulse-to-pulse
properties can be a natural consequence due to the magnetospheric geometry. We
investigate the relationship between drift rate, central frequency and their
temporal duration. The radius-to-frequency mapping is derived and simulated
within the assumptions of both dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic configurations.
The geometric results show that FRBs are emitted in field lines more curved
than open field lines for a dipolar geometry. This suggests that there are most
likely existing multipolar magnetic configurations in the emission region.

We present a high-resolution analysis of the host galaxy of fast radio burst
(FRB)~190608, an SB(r)c galaxy at $z=0.11778$ (hereafter HG 190608), to dissect
its local environment and its contributions to the FRB properties. Our Hubble
Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 ultraviolet and visible light image reveals
that the subarcsecond localization of FRB~190608 is coincident with a knot of
star-formation ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} = 1.5 \times 10^{-2}~ M_{\odot} \, \rm \,
yr^{-1} \, kpc^{-2}$) in the northwest spiral arm of HG~190608. Using H$\beta$
emission present in our Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field spectrum of the
galaxy with a surface brightness of $\mu_{\rm H\beta}=
\mathrm{(3.36\pm0.21)\times10^{-17}\;erg\;s^{-1}\;cm^{-2}\;arcsec^{-2}}$, we
infer an extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ surface brightness and compute a
dispersion measure (DM) from the interstellar medium of HG 190608 of $\rm
DM_{\rm Host,ISM} = 94 \pm 38~ \;pc\;cm^{-3}$. The galaxy rotates with a
circular velocity $v_{\rm circ} = \rm 141 \pm 8~ km\;s^{-1}$ at an inclination
$i_{\mathrm{gas}} = 37 \pm 3^\circ$, giving a dynamical mass $M_{\rm halo}^{\rm
dyn} \approx 10^{11.96 \pm 0.08}~M_{\odot}$. This implies a halo contribution
to the DM of $\rm DM_{\rm Host,Halo}= \rm 55\pm25 \;pc\;cm^{-3}$ subject to
assumptions on the density profile and fraction of baryons retained. From the
galaxy rotation curve, we infer a bar-induced pattern speed of $\Omega_p=34\pm
6\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}}$ using linear resonance theory. We then
calculate the maximum time since star-formation for a progenitor using the
furthest distance to the arm's leading edge within the localization, and find
$t_{\mathrm{enc}} = 21_{-6}^{+25}$ Myr. Unlike previous high-resolution studies
of FRB environments, we find no evidence of disturbed morphology, emission, or
kinematics for FRB 190608.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic transient events with duration
of order of microseconds to milliseconds and of unknown origin. They are known
to lie at cosmological distances, through localisation to host galaxies.
Recently, an FRB-like event was seen from the Milky Way magnetar SGR 1935+2154
by the CHIME and STARE2 telescopes. This is the only magnetar that has produced
FRB events in our galaxy. Finding similar events in the Milky Way is of great
interest to understanding FRB progenitors. Such events will be strongly
affected by the turbulent interstellar medium in the Milky Way, their intrinsic
energy distribution and their spatial locations within the plane of the Milky
Way. We examine these effects using models for the distribution of electrons in
the ISM to estimate the dispersion measure and pulse scattering of mock events,
and a range of models for the spatial distribution and luminosity functions,
including models motivated by the spatial distribution of the Milky Way's
magnetars. We evaluate the fraction of FRB events in the Milky Way that are
detectable by STARE2 for a range of ISM models, spatial distributions and burst
luminosity functions. In all the models examined, only a fraction of burst
events are detectable, mainly due to the scattering effects of the ISM. We find
that GReX, a proposed all-sky experiment, could increase the detection rate of
Milky Way FRB events by an order of magnitude, depending on assumptions made
about the luminosity function and scale-height of the FRBs.

A repeating source of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is recently discovered from a
globular cluster of M81. Association to a globular cluster (or other old
stellar systems) suggests that strongly magnetized neutron stars, which are the
most likely objects responsible for FRBs, are born not only when young massive
stars undergo core-collapse, but also by mergers of old white dwarfs. We find
that the fractional contribution to the total FRB rate by old stellar
populations is at least a few percent, and the precise fraction can be
constrained by FRB searches in the directions of nearby galaxies, both
star-forming and elliptical ones. Using very general arguments, we show that
the activity time of the M81-FRB object is between 10^4 and 10^6 years, and
more likely of order 10^5 years. The energetics of radio outbursts puts a lower
limit on the magnetic field strength of 10^{13} G, and the spin period > 0.2
sec, thereby ruling out the source being a milli-second pulsar. The upper limit
on the persistent X-ray luminosity (provided by Chandra), together with the
high FRB luminosity and frequent repetitions, severely constrains (or rules
out) the possibility that the M81-FRB is a scaled-up version of giant pulses
from Galactic pulsars. Finally, the 50 ns variability time of the FRB
lightcurve suggests that the emission is produced in a compact region inside
the neutron star magnetosphere, as it cannot be accounted for when the emission
is at distances > 10^{10} cm.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astronomical transients with millisecond
timescales occurring at cosmological distances. The observed time lag between
different energies of each FRB is well described by the inverse-square law of
the observed frequency, i.e., dispersion measure. Therefore, FRBs provide one
of the ideal laboratories to test Einstein's weak equivalence principle (WEP):
the hypothetical time lag between photons with different energies under a
gravitational potential. If WEP is violated, such evidence should be exposed
within the observational uncertainties of dispersion measures, unless the WEP
violation also depends on the inverse-square of the observed frequency. In this
work, we constrain the difference of gamma parameters ($\Delta\gamma$) between
photons with different energies using the observational uncertainties of FRB
dispersion measures, where $\Delta\gamma=0$ for Einstein's general relativity.
Adopting the averaged 'Shapiro time delay' for cosmological sources, FRB 121002
at $z=1.6\pm0.3$ and FRB 180817.J1533+42 at $z=1.0\pm0.2$ place the most
stringent constraints of $\log\Delta\gamma<-20.8\pm0.1$ and
$\log(\Delta\gamma/r_{E}) < -20.9\pm0.2$, respectively, where $r_{E}$ is the
energy ratio between the photons. The former is about three orders of magnitude
lower than those of other astrophysical sources in previous works under the
same formalization of the Shapiro time delay while the latter is comparable to
the tightest constraint so far.

PSR B0950+08 is a bright non-recycled pulsar whose single-pulse fluence
variability is reportedly large. Based on observations at two widely separated
frequencies, 55 MHz (NenuFAR) and 1.4 GHz (Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope), we review the properties of these single pulses. We conclude that
they are more similar to ordinary pulses of radio emission than to a special
kind of short and bright Giant Pulses, observed from only a handful of pulsars.
We argue that temporal variation of properties of interstellar medium along the
line of sight to this nearby pulsar, namely the fluctuating size of
decorrelation bandwidth of diffractive scintillation makes important
contribution to observed single-pulse fluence variability. We further present
interesting structures in the low-frequency single-pulse spectra that resemble
the "sad trombones" seen in Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs); although for PSR B0950+08
the upward frequency drift is also routinely present. We explain these spectral
features with radius-to-frequency mapping, similar to the model developed by
Wang et al. (2019) for FRBs. Finally, we speculate that microsecond-scale
fluence variability of the general pulsar population remains poorly known, and
that its further study may bring important clues about the nature of FRBs.

The CHIME/FRB Project has recently released its first catalog of fast radio
bursts (FRBs), containing 492 unique sources. We present results from angular
cross-correlations of CHIME/FRB sources with galaxy catalogs. We find a
statistically significant ($p$-value $\sim 10^{-4}$, accounting for
look-elsewhere factors) cross-correlation between CHIME FRBs and galaxies in
the redshift range $0.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, in three photometric galaxy
surveys: WISE$\times$SCOS, DESI-BGS, and DESI-LRG. The level of
cross-correlation is consistent with an order-one fraction of the CHIME FRBs
being in the same dark matter halos as survey galaxies in this redshift range.
We find statistical evidence for a population of FRBs with large host
dispersion measure ($\sim 400$ pc cm$^{-3}$), and show that this can plausibly
arise from gas in large halos ($M \sim 10^{14} M_\odot$), for FRBs near the
halo center ($r \lesssim 100$ kpc). These results will improve in future
CHIME/FRB catalogs, with more FRBs and better angular resolution.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12934v1
We propose that fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used as the probes to
constrain the possible anisotropic distribution of baryon matter in the
Universe. Monte Carlo simulations show that, 400 (800) FRBs are enough to
detect the anisotropy at 95\% (99\%) confidence level, if the dipole amplitude
is at the order of magnitude 0.01. However, much more FRBs are required to
tightly constrain the dipole direction. Even 1000 FRBs are far from enough to
constrain the dipole direction within angular uncertainty
$\Delta\theta<40^{\circ}$ at 95\% confidence level. The uncertainty on the
dispersion measure of host galaxy does not significantly affect the results. If
the dipole amplitude is in the level of 0.001, however, 1000 FRBs are not
enough to correctly detect the anisotropic signal.

A key tool astronomers have to investigate the nature of extragalactic
transients is their position on their host galaxies. Galactocentric offsets,
enclosed fluxes and the fraction of light statistic are widely used at
different wavelengths to help infer the nature of transient progenitors.
Motivated by the proposed link between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs),
we create a face-on image of the Milky Way using best estimates of its size,
structure and colour. We place Galactic magnetars, pulsars, low mass and high
mass X-ray binaries on this image, using the available distance information.
Galactocentric offsets, enclosed fluxes and fraction of light distributions for
these systems are compared to extragalactic transient samples. We find that
FRBs follow the distributions for Galactic neutron stars closest, with 24 (75
per cent) of the Anderson-Darling tests we perform having a p-value greater
than 0.05. This suggests that FRBs are located on their hosts in a manner
consistent with Galactic neutron stars on the Milky Way's light, although we
cannot determine which specific neutron star population is the best match. The
Galactic distributions are consistent with other extragalactic transients much
less often across the range of comparisons made, with type Ia SNe in second
place, at only 33 per cent of tests exceeding 0.05. Overall, our results
provide further support for FRB models invoking isolated young neutron stars,
or binaries containing a neutron star.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12269v1
One widely discussed mechanism to produce highly coherent radio emission of
fast radio bursts (FRBs) is coherent emission by bunches, either via curvature
radiation or inverse Compton scattering (ICS). It has been suggested that the
plasma oscillation effect can significantly suppress coherent emission by
bunches, so that the bunching mechanism may not be the dominant mechanism for
FRBs. We critically examine two physical conditions for significant plasma
suppression and argue that the suppression effect is not important for the
coherent ICS mechanism. A suppression factor for curvature radiation $f_{\rm
cur}$ is possible if the giant bunch charge is surrounded by a high density
plasma so that $\omega_p \gg \omega$ is satisfied, and if the electric field
strength along the magnetic field lines ($E_\parallel$) in the emission region
is not large enough to separate the surrounding plasma. However, even under
these conditions, the derived $f_{\rm cur}$ is about 6 orders of magnitude
greater than that derived in previous work, so that the suppression effect is
not as significant as predicted before. We conclude that bunched coherent
curvature radiation is still a plausible mechanism to power FRB emission, even
though a suppression factor of the order $f_{\rm cur} \sim 10^{-3}$ should be
considered in future modeling.

We present the Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor to probe
the brightest bursts in the radio sky. Building on the success of STARE2, we
will search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) emitted from Galactic magnetars as
well as bursts from nearby galaxies. GReX will search down to ten microseconds
time resolution, allowing us to find new super giant radio pulses from Milky
Way pulsars and study their broadband emission. The proposed instrument will
employ ultra-wide band (0.7-2 GHz) feeds coupled to a high performance
(receiver temperature 10 K) low noise amplifier (LNA) originally developed for
the DSA-110 and DSA-2000 projects. In GReX Phase I (GReX-I), unit systems will
be deployed at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) and Big Smoky Valley,
Nevada. Phase II will expand the array, placing feeds in India, Australia, and
elsewhere in order to build up to continuous coverage of nearly 4$\pi$
steradians and to increase our exposure to the Galactic plane. We model the
local magnetar population to forecast for GReX, finding the improved
sensitivity and increased exposure to the Galactic plane could lead to dozens
of FRB-like bursts per year.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed radio bursts prevailing in the
universe. The recent detection of FRB~200428 from a Galactic magnetar suggested
that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars, but it is unclear whether the
majority of cosmological FRBs, especially the actively repeating ones, are
produced from the magnetar channel. Here we report the detection of 1863
polarised bursts from the repeating source FRB~20201124A during a dedicated
radio observational campaign of Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio
Telescope (FAST). The large sample of radio bursts detected in 88\,hr over 54
days indicate a significant, irregular, short-time variation of the Faraday
rotation measure (RM) of the source during the first 36 days, followed by a
constant RM during the later 18 days. Significant circular polarisation up to
75\% was observed in a good fraction of bursts. Evidence suggests that some
low-level circular polarisation originates from the conversion from linear
polarisation during the propagation of the radio waves, but an intrinsic
radiation mechanism is required to produce the higher degree of circular
polarisation. All of these features provide evidence for a more complicated,
dynamically evolving, magnetised immediate environment around this FRB source.
Its host galaxy was previously known. Our optical observations reveal that it
is a Milky-Way-sized, metal-rich, barred-spiral galaxy at redshift
$z=0.09795\pm0.00003$, with the FRB source residing in a low stellar density,
interarm region at an intermediate galactocentric distance, an environment not
directly expected for a young magnetar formed during an extreme explosion of a
massive star.

Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is the basis of modern astronomy and
astrophysics. Testing the validity of basic assumptions of GR is important. In
this work, we test a possible violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle
(WEP), i.e., there might be a time-lag between photons of different frequencies
caused by the effect of gravitational fields if the speeds of photons are
slightly different at different frequencies. We use Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) ,
which are astronomical transients with millisecond timescales detected in the
radio frequency range. Being at cosmological distances, accumulated time delay
of FRBs can be caused by the plasma in between an FRB source and an observer,
and by gravitational fields in the path of the signal. We segregate the delay
due to dispersion and gravitational field using the post-Newtonian formalism
(PPN) parameter $\Delta \gamma$, which defines the space-curvature due to
gravity by a unit test mass. We did not detect any time-delay from FRBs but
obtained tight constraints on the upper limit of $\Delta \gamma$. For
FRB20181117C with $z = 1.83 \pm 0.28$ and $\nu_{obs}$ = $676.5\,{\rm MHz}$, the
best possible constraint is obtained at log($\Delta \gamma$) = $-21.58
^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$ and log($\Delta \gamma$/$r_{\rm E}$) = $-21.75
^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$, respectively, where $r_{\rm E}$ is the energy ratio of two
photons of the same FRB signal. This constraint is about one order of magnitude
better than the previous constraint obtained with FRBs, and five orders tighter
than any constraint obtained using other cosmological sources.

Scintillation of compact radio sources results from the interference between
images caused by multipath propagation, and probes the intervening scattering
plasma and the velocities of the emitting source and scattering screen. In
FRB20201124A, a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) which entered a period of
extreme activity, we obtained many burst detections in observations at the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Effelsberg 100\,m
Radio Telescope. Bursts nearby in time show similar scintillation patterns, and
we measure a scintillation timescale of $14.3\pm1.2$\,min and $7\pm2$\,min at
Effelsberg (1370\,MHz) and uGMRT (650\,MHz), respectively, by correlating burst
pair spectra. The scintillation bandwidth scaled to 1\,GHz is $0.5\pm0.1$\,MHz,
and the inferred scintillation velocity at Effelsberg is
$V_{\mathrm{ISS}}\approx (59\pm7) \sqrt{d_{l}/2\,\rm{kpc}}~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$,
higher than Earth's velocity for any screen beyond a lens distance of $d_{l}
\gtrsim 400\,$pc. From the measured scintillation bandwidth, FRB20201124A has
comparatively lower scattering than nearby pulsars, and is underscattered by a
factor of $\sim 30$ or $\sim 1200$ compared to the NE2001 and YMW16 model
predictions respectively. This underscattering, together with the measured
scintillation velocity are consistent with a scattering screen more nearby the
Earth at $d_{l} \sim 400\,$pc, rather than at the 2\,kpc spiral arm which
NE2001 predicts to be the dominant source of scattering. With future
measurements, the distance, geometry, and velocity of the scattering screen
could be obtained through modelling of the annual variation in $V_{\rm ISS}$,
or through inter-station time delays or interferometric observations.
Scintillation/scattering measurements of FRBs could help improve Galactic
electron density models, particularly in the Galactic halo or at high Galactic
latitudes.

We report the discovery of seven new Galactic pulsars with the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment's Fast Radio Burst backend (CHIME/FRB).
These sources were first identified via single pulses in CHIME/FRB, then
followed up with CHIME/Pulsar. Four sources appear to be rotating radio
transients (RRATs), pulsar-like sources with occasional single pulse emission
with an underlying periodicity. Of those four sources, three have detected
periods ranging from 220 ms to 2.726 s. Three sources have more persistent but
still intermittent emission and are likely intermittent or nulling pulsars. We
have determined phase-coherent timing solutions for the latter three. These
seven sources are the first discovery of previously unknown Galactic sources
with CHIME/FRB and highlight the potential of fast radio burst detection
instruments to search for intermittent Galactic radio sources.

We further explored the radius-to-frequency mapping in cases of FRBs. An
analytical treatment of Lyutikov (2020) is presented. The frequency dependence
of the drifting rate and the drifting timescale are obtained. The aberration
effect and the twist of the magnetic field lines may result in drifting in both
directions. For one FRB, the burst width is larger at lower frequency according
to the radius-to-frequency mapping. For the FRB population, the magnetic fields
of the repeaters may be larger than that of the non-repeaters. Then, according
to the radius-to-frequency mapping, the burst widths of the repeaters will be
wider than that of the apparent non-repeaters. If similar window function (or
emission cones) like that of pulsars and magnetars is also at work in the case
of FRBs, then the window function may explain the single or multiple components
of FRB profiles. The radius-to-frequency mapping modeling is to some degree
independent of the underlying radio emission mechanism.

We extend the Malitsky-Tam forward-reflected-backward (FRB) splitting method
for inclusion problems of monotone operators to nonconvex minimization
problems. By assuming the generalized concave Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL)
property of a quadratic regularization of the objective, we show that the FRB
method converges globally to a stationary point of the objective and enjoys
finite length property. The sharpness of our approach is guaranteed by virtue
of the exact modulus associated with the generalized concave KL property.
Numerical experiments suggest that FRB is competitive compared to the
Douglas-Rachford method and the Bo\c{t}-Csetnek inertial Tseng's method.

We describe a pipeline to measure scintillation in fast radio bursts (FRBs)
detected by CHIME/FRB in the 400-800 MHz band by analyzing the frequency
structure of the FRB's spectrum. We use the pipeline to measure the
characteristic frequency bandwidths of scintillation between $4-100$ kHz in 12
FRBs corresponding to timescales of $\sim$2-40 $\mu$s for 10 FRBs detected by
CHIME/FRB. For the other two FRBs, we did not detect scintillation in the
region our analysis is sensitive. We compared the measured scintillation
timescales to the NE2001 predictions for the scintillation timescales from the
Milky Way. We find a strong correlation to be an indication that in most
instances, the observed scintillation of FRBs can be explained by the Milky
Way.

We present the localization and host galaxies of one repeating and two
apparently non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts. FRB20180301A was detected and
localized with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to a star-forming galaxy at
$z=0.3304$. FRB20191228A, and FRB20200906A were detected and localized by the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder to host galaxies at $z=0.2430$ and
$z=0.3688$, respectively. We combine these with 13 other well-localized FRBs in
the literature, and analyze the host galaxy properties. We find no significant
differences in the host properties of repeating and apparently non-repeating
FRBs. FRB hosts are moderately star-forming, with masses slightly offset from
the star-forming main-sequence. Star formation and low-ionization nuclear
emission-line region (LINER) emission are major sources of ionization in FRB
host galaxies, with the former dominant in repeating FRB hosts. FRB hosts do
not track stellar mass and star formation as seen in field galaxies (more than
95% confidence). FRBs are rare in massive red galaxies, suggesting that
progenitor formation channels are not solely dominated by delayed channels
which lag star formation by Gigayears. The global properties of FRB hosts are
indistinguishable from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs) hosts, and the spatial offset (from galaxy centers) of FRBs is
mostly inconsistent with that of the Galactic neutron star population (95%
confidence). The spatial offsets of FRBs (normalized to the galaxy effective
radius) also differ from those of globular clusters (GCs) in late- and
early-type galaxies with 95% confidence.

FRB 190520B, a repeating FRB near-twin of FRB 121102, was discovered
\citep{N21} to have a dispersion measure excess over the intergalactic and
Galactic contributions of about 900 pc-cm$^{-3}$, attributable to its host
galaxy or near-source environment. This excess varies on a time scale of $\sim
30\,$y and might be explained by a supernova remnant no more than a few decades
old. A magnetic field in equipartition with the remnant's expansion would be
${\cal O}(1\,\text{G})$. I suggest the use of baseband data to measure very
large rotation measures.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07417v1
Extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have large dispersion measures (DMs)
and are unique probes of intergalactic electron density fluctuations. By using
the recently released First CHIME/FRB Catalog, we reexamined the structure
function (SF) of DM fluctuations. It shows a large DM fluctuation similar to
that previously reported in Xu & Zhang (2020), but no clear correlation hinting
towards large scale turbulence is reproduced with this larger sample. To
suppress the distortion effect from FRB distances and their host DMs, we focus
on a subset of CHIME catalog with DM $<500$ pc cm$^{-3}$. A trend of
non-constant SF and non-zero correlation function (CF) at angular separations
$\theta$ less than $10^\circ$ is seen, but with large statistical
uncertainties. The difference found between SF and that derived from CF at
$\theta \lesssim 10^\circ$ can be ascribed to the large statistical
uncertainties or the density inhomogeneities on scales on the order of $100$
Mpc. The possible correlation of electron density fluctuations and
inhomogeneities of density distribution should be tested when several thousands
of FRBs are available.

The extremely high brightness temperature of fast radio bursts (FRBs)
requires that their emission mechanism must be "coherent", either through
concerted particle emission by bunches or through an exponential growth of a
plasma wave mode or radiation amplitude via certain maser mechanisms. The
bunching mechanism has been mostly discussed within the context of curvature
radiation or cyclotron/synchrotron radiation. Here we propose a family of model
invoking coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of bunched particles that
may operate within or just outside of the magnetosphere of a flaring magnetar.
Crustal oscillations during the flaring event may excite low-frequency
electromagnetic waves near the magnetar surface. The X-mode of these waves
could penetrate through the magnetosphere. Bunched relativistic particles in
the charge starved region inside the magnetosphere or in the current sheet
outside of the magnetosphere would upscatter these low-frequency waves to
produce GHz emission to power FRBs. The ICS mechanism has a much larger
emission power for individual electrons than curvature radiation. This greatly
reduces the required degree of coherence in bunches, alleviating several
criticisms to the bunching mechanism raised in the context of curvature
radiation. The emission is $\sim 100\%$ linearly polarized (with the
possibility of developing circular polarization) with a constant or varying
polarization angle across each burst. The mechanism can account for a
narrow-band spectrum and a frequency downdrifting pattern, as commonly observed
in repeating FRBs.

We present the results of a multiwavelength campaign of FRB 20201124A, the
third closest repeating fast radio burst recently localized in a nearby
(z=0.0978) galaxy. Deep VLA observations led to the detection of quiescent
radio emission, also marginally visible in X-rays with Chandra. Imaging at 22
GHz allowed us to resolve the source on a scale of $\gtrsim$ 1 arcsec and
locate it at the position of the FRB, within an error of 0.2 arcsec. EVN and
e-MERLIN observations sampled small angular scales, from 2 to 100 mas,
providing tight upper limits on the presence of a compact source and evidence
for diffuse radio emission. We argue that this emission is associated with
enhanced star formation activity in the proximity of the FRB, corresponding to
a star formation rate of $\approx 10\ {\rm M}_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$. The surface
star formation rate at the location of FRB 20201124A is two orders of magnitude
larger than typically observed in other precisely localized FRBs. Such a high
SFR is indicative of this FRB source being a new-born magnetar produced from a
SN explosion of a massive star progenitor. Upper limits to the X-ray
counterparts of 49 radio bursts observed in our simultaneous FAST, SRT and
Chandra campaign are consistent with a magnetar scenario.

The detection of the gravitational wave counterpart GRB 170817A,
underluminous compared to the cosmological GRB population by a factor of
10,000, motivates significant effort in detecting and localizing a dim, nearby,
and slightly off-axis population of short GRBs. Swift/BAT is the most sensitive
GRB detector in operation, and the only one that regularly localizes GRBs to
arcminute precision, critical to rapid followup studies. However, the utility
of BAT in targeted sub-threshold searches had been historically curtailed by
the unavailability of the necessary raw data for analysis. The new availability
of time-tagged event (TTE) data from the GUANO system (arXiv:2005.01751),
motivates renewed focus on developing sensitive targeted search analysis
techniques to maximally exploit these data. While computationally cheap, we
show that the typical coded-mask deconvolution imaging is limited in its
sensitivity due to several factors. We formalize a maximum likelihood framework
for the analysis of BAT data wherein signals are forward modelled through the
full instrument response, and -- coupled with the development of new response
models -- demonstrate its superior sensitivity to typical imaging via archival
comparisons, injection campaigns, and, after implementing as a targeted search,
a large number of low-latency GRB discoveries and confirmed arcminute
localizations to date. We also demonstrate independent localization of some
out-of-FOV GRBs for the first time. NITRATES's increased sensitivity boosts the
discovery rate of GRB 170817A-like events in BAT by a factor of at least
$3-4$x, along with enabling joint analyses and searches with other GRB, GW,
neutrino, and FRB instruments. We provide public access to the response
functions and search pipeline code.

Very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) localisations of repeating fast
radio bursts (FRBs) have demonstrated a diversity of local environments: from
nearby star-forming regions to globular clusters. Here we report the VLBI
localisation of FRB 20201124A using an ad-hoc array of dishes that also
participate in the European VLBI Network (EVN). In our campaign, we detected 18
total bursts from FRB 20201124A at two separate epochs. By combining the
visibilities from both observing epochs, we were able to localise FRB 20201124A
with a 1-$\sigma$ error of 4.5 milliarcseconds (mas). We use the relatively
large burst sample to investigate astrometric accuracy, and find that for
$\gtrsim20$ baselines ($\gtrsim7$ dishes) that we can robustly reach
milliarcsecond precision even using single-burst data sets. Sub-arcsecond
precision is still possible for single bursts, even when only $\sim$ six
baselines (four dishes) are available. We explore two methods for determining
the individual burst positions: the peaks of the dirty maps and a Gaussian fit
to the cross fringe pattern on the dirty maps. We found the latter to be more
reliable due to the lower mean and standard deviation in the offsets from the
FRB position. Our VLBI work places FRB 20201124A 705$\pm$26 mas (1-$\sigma$
errors) from the optical centre of the host galaxy, and consistent with
originating from within the recently-discovered extended radio structure
associated with star-formation in the host galaxy. Future high-resolution
optical observations, e.g. with Hubble Space Telescope, can determine the
proximity of our FRB 20201124A VLBI position to nearby knots of star formation.

It is commonplace in pulsar and fast radio burst (FRB) literature to estimate
sky temperature by frequency-scaling of the Haslam et al. (1982) 408 MHz map. I
suggest that this practice should stop, in favor of using readily-available
global sky models of diffuse foregrounds. This practical change will improve
accuracy of pulse flux estimates.

The repeating FRB source, FRB 20201124A, was found to be highly active in
March and April 2021. We observed the source with the Effelsberg 100-m radio
telescope at 1.36 GHz on 9 April 2021 and detected 20 bursts. A downward drift
in frequency over time is clearly seen from the majority of bursts in our
sample. A structure-maximizing dispersion measure (DM) search on the
multi-component bursts in our sample yields a DM of 411.6$\pm$0.6 pc/cm$^3$. We
find that the rotation measure (RM) of the bursts varies around their mean
value of -605 rad/m$^2$ with a standard deviation of 11.1 rad/m$^2$. This RM
magnitude is 10 times larger than the expected Galactic contribution along this
line of sight (LoS). We estimate a LoS magnetic field strength of 4--6 $\mu$G,
assuming that the entire host galaxy DM contributes to the RM. Further
polarization measurements will help determine FRB 20201124A's RM stability. The
bursts are highly linearly polarized, with some showing signs of circular
polarization, the first for a repeating FRB. Their polarization position angles
(PAs) are flat across the burst envelopes and vary between bursts. We argue
that the varying polarization fractions and PAs of FRB 20201124A are similar to
known magnetospheric emission from pulsars, while the observed circular
polarization, combined with the RM variability, is hard to explain with Faraday
conversion. The high linear polarization fractions, flat PAs, and downward
drift from FRB 20201124A bursts are similar to previous repeating sources,
while the observed circular polarization is a newly seen behaviour among
repeaters.

The first Fast Radio Burst (FRB) to be precisely localized was associated
with a luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Recently, a second FRB/PRS
association was discovered for another repeating source of FRBs. However, it is
not clear what makes FRBs or PRS or how they are related. We compile FRB and
PRS properties to consider the population of FRB/PRS sources. We suggest a
practical definition for PRS as FRB associations with luminosity greater than
$10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ that is not attributed to star-formation
activity in the host galaxy. We model the probability distribution of the
fraction of FRBs with PRS for repeaters and non-repeaters, showing there is not
yet evidence for repeaters to be preferentially associated with PRS. We discuss
how FRB/PRS sources may be distinguished by the combination of active
repetition and an excess dispersion measure local to the FRB environment. We
use CHIME/FRB event statistics to bound the mean per-source repetition rate of
FRBs to be between 25 and 440 yr$^{-1}$. We use this to provide a bound on the
density of FRB-emitting sources in the local universe of between
$2.2\times10^2$ and $5.2\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$ assuming a pulsar-like beam
width for FRB emission. This density implies that PRS may comprise as much as
1\% of compact, luminous radio sources detected in the local universe. The
cosmic density and phenomenology of PRS are similar to that of the
newly-discovered, off-nuclear "wandering" AGN. We argue that it is likely that
some PRS have already been detected and misidentified as AGN.

We provide constraints on the nature of particle bunches that power fast
radio bursts (FRBs) in the coherent curvature radiation model. It has been
shown that current-induced perturbation to the motion of individual particles
results in a high-energy, incoherent component of emission. We consider
photo-magnetic interactions and show that the high-energy radiation can produce
pairs which screen the accelerating electric field. We find that to avoid
catastrophic cascades that quench emission, bunches capable of producing FRBs
must have a modest density $n_e \approx 10^{13-14}\, {\rm cm^{-3}}$, and likely
propagate along field lines with large curvature radii, $\rho > 10^8 \, {\rm
cm}$. This rules out rapidly rotating magnetars as FRB sources within the
coherent curvature radiation model.

We conducted a drift-scan observation campaign using the 305-m Arecibo
telescope in January and March 2020 when the observatory was temporarily closed
during the intense earthquakes and the initial outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, respectively. The primary objective of the survey was to search for
fast radio transients, including Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and Rotating Radio
Transients (RRATs). We used the 7-beam ALFA receiver to observe different
sections of the sky within the declination region $\sim$(10$-$20) deg on 23
nights and collected 160 hours of data in total. We searched our data for
single-pulse transients, covering up to a maximum dispersion measure of 11 000
pc cm$^{-3}$ at which the dispersion delay across the entire bandwidth is equal
to the 13 s transit length of our observations. The analysis produced more than
18 million candidates. Machine learning techniques sorted the radio frequency
interference and possibly astrophysical candidates, allowing us to visually
inspect and confirm the candidate transients. We found no evidence for new
astrophysical transients in our data. We also searched for emission from
repeated transient signals, but found no evidence for such sources. We detected
single pulses from two known pulsars in our observations and their measured
flux densities are consistent with the expected values. Based on our
observations and sensitivity, we estimated the upper limit for the FRB rate to
be $<$2.8$\times10^5$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence of 0.16 Jy ms at
1.4 GHz, which is consistent with the rates from other telescopes and surveys.

We developed a GPU based single-pulse search pipeline (GSP) with
candidate-archiving database. Largely based upon the infrastructure of Open
source pulsar search and analysis toolkit (PRESTO), GSP implements GPU
acceleration of the de-dispersion and integrates a candidate-archiving
database. We applied GSP to the data streams from the commensal radio astronomy
FAST survey (CRAFTS), which resulted in a quasi-real-time processing. The
integrated candidate database facilitates synergistic usage of multiple
machine-learning tools and thus improves efficient identification of radio
pulsars such as rotating radio transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).
We first tested GSP on pilot CRAFTS observations with the FAST Ultra-Wide Band
(UWB) receiver. GSP detected all pulsars known from the the Parkes multibeam
pulsar survey in the respective sky area covered by the FAST-UWB. GSP also
discovered 13 new pulsars. We measured the computational efficiency of GSP to
be ~120 times faster than the original PRESTO and ~60 times faster than a
MPI-parallelized version of PRESTO.

The rapid accumulation of observed Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) originating from
cosmological distances makes it likely that some will be strongly lensed by
intervening matter along the line of sight. Detection of lensed FRB repeaters,
which account for a noteworthy fraction of the total population, will allow not
only an accurate measurement of the lensing time delay, but also follow-up
high-resolution observations to pinpoint the location of the lensed images.
Recent works proposed to use such strongly-lensed FRBs to derive constraints on
the current expansion rate $ H_{0} $ as well as on cosmic curvature. Here we
study the prospects for placing constraints on departures from general
relativity via such systems. Using an ensemble of simulated events, we focus on
the gravitational slip parameter $\gamma_{\rm PN}$ in screened modified gravity
models and show that FRB time-delay measurements can yield constraints as tight
as $ \left| \gamma_{\rm PN}-1\right| \lesssim 0.04\times(\Lambda/100\rm
kpc)\times[N/10]^{-1/2} $ at $1\sigma$ with $10$ detections.

We report the observations of the highly active FRb20201124A with the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 550-750~MHz. These observations in
the incoherent array mode simultaneously provided an arcsecond localization of
bursts from \rss, the discovery of persistent radio emission associated with
the host galaxy, and the detection of 48 bursts. Using the brightest burst in
the sample ($F= 108~{\rm Jy~ms}$) we find a structure-maximizing dispersion
measure of $410.8 \pm 0.5~{\rm pc~cm}^{-3}$. We find that our observations are
complete down to a fluence level of $10~{\rm Jy~ms}$, above which the
cumulative burst rate scales as a power-law $R(>\!F) = 10~{\rm hr}^{-1}
\left(F/10\mathrm{~Jy~ms}\right)^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = -1.2 \pm 0.2$. We
find that the bursts are on average wider than those reported for other
repeating FRBs. We find that the waiting time between bursts is well
approximated by an exponential distribution with a mean of $\sim 2.9$ min
during our observations. We searched for periodicities using both a standard
Fourier domain method and the Fast Folding Algorithm, but found no significant
candidates. We measure bulk spectro-temporal drift rates between $-0.75$ and
$-20~{\rm MHz~ms}^{-1}$. Finally, we use the brightest burst to set an upper
limit to the scattering time of 11.1~ms at 550~MHz. The localization of
FRB20201124A adds strength to the proof-of-concept method described in our
earlier work and serves as a potential model for future localizations and
follow-up of repeating FRBs with the uGMRT.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10738v1
We introduce a toy model for the time-frequency structure of fast radio
bursts (FRB), in which the observed emission is produced as a narrowly-peaked
intrinsic spectral energy distribution sweeps down in frequency across the
instrumental bandpass as a power-law in time. Though originally motivated by
emission models which invoke a relativistic shock, the model could in principle
apply to a wider range of emission scenarios. We quantify the burst's
detectability using the frequency bandwidth over which most of its
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is accumulated. We demonstrate that by varying just
a single parameter of the toy model-the power-law index \beta of the frequency
drift rate-one can transform a long (and hence preferentially time-resolved)
burst with a narrow time-integrated spectrum into a shorter burst with a broad
power-law time-integrated spectrum. We suggest that burst-to-burst diversity in
the value of \beta could generate the dichotomy between burst duration and
frequency-width recently found by CHIME. In shock models, the value of \beta is
related to the radial density profile of external medium, which in light of the
preferentially longer duration of bursts from repeating sources may point to
diversity in the external environments surrounding repeating versus one-off FRB
sources.

We advance theoretical methods for studying propagation effects in the Fast
Radio Burst (FRB) spectra. We derive their autocorrelation function in the
model with diffractive lensing and strong Kolmogorov-type scintillations and
analytically obtain the spectra lensed on different plasma density profiles.
With these tools, we reanalyze the highest frequency 4-8 GHz data of Gajjar et
al. (2018) for the repeating FRB 20121102A (FRB 121102). In the data we
discover, first, a remarkable spectral structure of almost equidistant peaks
separated by $95\pm 16$ MHz. We suggest that it can originate from diffractive
lensing of the FRB signals on a compact gravitating object of mass $10^{-4}\,
M_\odot$ or on a plasma underdensity near the source. Second, the spectra
include erratic interstellar, presumably Milky Way scintillations. We extract
their decorrelation bandwidth $3.3\pm 0.6$ MHz at reference frequency 6 GHz.
The third feature is a GHz-scale pattern which, as we find, linearly drifts
with time and presumably represents a wide-band propagation effect, e.g.
GHz-scale scintillations. Fourth, many spectra are dominated by a narrow peak
at 7.1 GHz. We suggest that it can be caused by a propagation through a plasma
lens, e.g., in the host galaxy. Fifth, separating the propagation effects, we
give strong arguments that the intrinsic progenitor spectrum has narrow GHz
bandwidth and variable central frequency. This confirms expectations from the
previous observations. We discuss alternative interpretations of the above
spectral features.

The origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs), astronomical transients with
millisecond timescales, remain unknown. One of the difficulties stems from the
possibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of
them have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited
observing periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified
as non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into
repeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work,
we classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning,
without relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating
FRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the
unsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior
knowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that
non-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognise the
FRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a
corresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) database. We found that the
unsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95
per cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474
non-repeater sources. This work paves the way to a new classification of
repeaters and non-repeaters based on a single epoch observation of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07881v2
We examine the possibility that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are emitted inside
the magnetosphere of a magnetar. On its way out, the radio wave must interact
with a low-density $e^\pm$ plasma in the outer magnetosphere at radii
$R=10^9$-$10^{10}\,$cm. In this region, the magnetospheric particles have a
huge cross section for scattering the wave. As a result, the wave strongly
interacts with the magnetosphere and compresses it, depositing the FRB energy
into the compressed field and the scattered radiation. The scattered spectrum
extends to the $\gamma$-ray band and triggers $e^\pm$ avalanche, further
boosting the opacity. These processes choke FRBs, disfavoring scenarios with a
radio source confined at $R\ll 10^{10}\,$cm. Observed FRBs can be emitted by
magnetospheric flare ejecta transporting energy to large radii.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astronomical radio transients with
extremely short intrinsic duration. Until now, the physical origins of them
still remain elusive especially for the non-repeating FRBs. Strongly inspired
by recent progress on possible evidence of Earth-mass primordial black holes,
we revisit the model of Earth-mass primordial black holes mergers as sources
for non-repeating FRBs. Under the null hypothesis that the observed
non-repeating FRBs are originated from the mergers of Earth-mass primordial
black holes, we analyzed four independent samples of non-repeating FRBs to
study the model parameters i.e. the typical charge value $q_{\rm{c}}$ and the
power index $\alpha$ of the charge distribution function of the primordial
black hole population $\phi(q) \propto (q/q_{\rm{c}})^{-\alpha}$ which describe
how the charge was distributed in the population. $q$ is the charge of
  the hole in the unit of $\sqrt{G} M$, where $M$ is the mass of the hole. It
turns out that this model can explain the observed data well. {Assuming the
monochromatic mass spectrum for primordial black holes}, we get the average
value of typical charge $\bar{q}_{\rm{c}}/10^{-5}=1.59^{+0.08}_{-0.18}$ and the
power index $\bar{\alpha}=4.53^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ by combining the fitting
results given by four non-repeating FRB samples. The event rate of the
non-repeating FRBs can be explained in the context of this model, if the
abundance of the primordial black hole populations with charge $q \gtrsim
10^{-6}$ is larger than $10^{-5}$ which is far below the upper limit given by
current observations for the abundance of Earth-mass primordial black holes. In
the future, simultaneous detection of FRBs and high frequency gravitational
waves produced by mergers of Earth-mass primordial black holes may directly
confirm or deny this model.

In this work, we propose an accreting stellar binary model for understanding
the active periodic fast radio bursts (FRBs). The system consists of a stellar
compact object (CO) and a donor star (DS) companion in an eccentric orbit,
where the DS fills its own Roche lobe near the periastron. The CO accretes the
material from the DS and then drive relativistic magnetic blobs. The
interaction between the magnetic blobs and the stellar wind of the DS produces
a pair of shocks. We find that both of the reverse shock and the forward shock
are likely to produce FRBs via synchrotron maser mechanism. We show that this
system can in principle sufficiently produce highly active FRBs with a long
lifetime, and also can naturally explain the periodicity and the duty cycle of
the activity as appeared in FRBs 180916 and 121102. The radio nebula excited by
the long-term injection of magnetic blobs into the surrounding environment may
account for the associated persistent radio source. In addiction, we discuss
the possible multi-wavelength counterparts of FRB 180916 in the context of this
model. Finally, we encourage the search for FRBs in the ultraluminous X-ray
sources.

We discuss dissipative processes occurring during production and escape of
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from magnetars' magnetospheres, the presumed loci of
FRBs. High magnetic fields are required in the emission region, both to account
for the overall energetics of FRBs, and in order to suppress ``normal''
(non-coherent) radiative losses of radio emitting particles; this limits the
emission radii to $\leq {\rm few} \times 10 R_{NS}$. Radiative losses by
particles in the strong FRB pulse may occur in the outer regions of the
magnetosphere for longer rotation periods, $P\geq 1$ second. These losses are
suppressed by several effects: (i) the ponderomotive pre-acceleration of
background plasma along the direction of wave propagation (losses reduced
approximately as $\gamma_\parallel^{3}$: smaller frequency, $ \propto
\gamma_\parallel^2$ in power, and times scales stretched, $ \propto
\gamma_\parallel$); this acceleration is non-dissipative and is reversed on the
declining part of the pulse; (ii) Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effects (long
radiation formation length and ensuing destructive interference of scattered
waves). In some cases an FRB pulse may be dissipated on external perturbations
(e.g., an incoming pulse of Alfven waves): this may produce a pulse of UV/soft
X-rays, a swan song of an FRB, possibly detectable by Chandra.

We collect 133 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), including 110 non-repeating and 23
repeating ones, and systematically investigate their observational properties.
To check the frequency dependence of FRB classifications, we define our samples
with a central frequency below/above 1GHz as subsample I/II. We find that there
is a clear bimodal distribution of pulse width for the subsample I. And If we
classify FRBs into short FRBs (\emph{s}FRBs) ($<$100 ms) and long FRBs
(\emph{l}FRBs) ($>$100 ms) as done for short and long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs),
the \emph{s}FRBs at higher central frequency are commonly shorter than those at
lower central frequency not only for non-repeating but also repeating
\emph{s}FRBs. Secondly, we find that fluence and peak flux density are
correlated with a power law relation of $F \varpropto S{^{\gamma}_{p,obs}}$ for
both \emph{s}FRBs and \emph{l}FRBs whose distributions are obviously different.
Thirdly, the \emph{l}FRBs with isotropic energies ranging from $10^{42}$ to
$10^{44}$ erg are more energetic than the \emph{s}FRBs in the $F- DM_{EX}$
plane, indicating that they are two representative types. Finally, it is
interestingly note that the peak flux density behaves an independence on the
redshift when the distance of the FRBs becomes far enough, which is similar to
the scenario of peak flux evolving with redshift in the field of GRBs. We
predict that fainter FRBs at higher redshift of $z>2$ can be successfully
detected by FAST and SKA in the near future.

The microlensing effect has developed into a powerful technique for a diverse
range of applications including exoplanet discoveries, structure of the Milky
Way, constraints on MAssive Compact Halo Objects, and measurements of the size
and profile of quasar accretion discs. In this paper, we consider a special
type of microlensing events where the sources are fast radio bursts with
$\sim$milliseconds (ms) durations for which the relative motion between the
lens and source is negligible. In this scenario, it is possible to temporally
resolve the individual microimages. As a result, a method beyond the inverse
ray shooting (IRS) method, which only evaluates the total magnification of all
microimages, is needed. We therefore implement an algorithm for identifying
individual microimages and computing their magnifications and relative time
delays. We validate our algorithm by comparing to analytical predictions for a
single microlens case and find excellent agreement. We show that the
superposition of pulses from individual microimages produces a light curve that
appears as multi-peaked FRBs. The relative time delays between pulses can reach
0.1--1 ms for stellar-mass lenses and hence can already be resolved temporally
by current facilities. Although not yet discovered, microlensing of FRBs will
become regular events and surpass the number of quasar microlensing events in
the near future when $10^{4-5}$ FRBs are expected to be discovered on a daily
basis. Our algorithm provides a way of generating the microlensing light curve
that can be used for constraining stellar mass distribution in distant
galaxies.

The event rate, energy distribution, and time-domain behaviour of repeating
fast radio bursts (FRBs) contains essential information regarding their
physical nature and central engine, which are as yet unknown. As the first
precisely-localized source, FRB 121102 has been extensively observed and shows
non-Poisson clustering of bursts over time and a power-law energy distribution.
However, the extent of the energy distribution towards the fainter end was not
known. Here we report the detection of 1652 independent bursts with a peak
burst rate of 122~hr^{-1}, in 59.5 hours spanning 47 days. A peak in the
isotropic equivalent energy distribution is found to be ~4.8 x 10^{37} erg at
1.25~GHz, below which the detection of bursts is suppressed. The burst energy
distribution is bimodal, and well characterized by a combination of a
log-normal function and a generalized Cauchy function. The large number of
bursts in hour-long spans allow sensitive periodicity searches between 1 ms and
1000 s. The non-detection of any periodicity or quasi-periodicity poses
challenges for models involving a single rotating compact object. The high
burst rate also implies that FRBs must be generated with a high radiative
efficiency, disfavoring emission mechanisms with large energy requirements or
contrived triggering conditions.

The study of astrophysical plasma lensing, such as in the case of extreme
scattering events, has typically been conducted using the geometric limit of
optics, neglecting wave effects. However, for the lensing of coherent sources
such as pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), wave effects can play an
important role. Asymptotic methods, such as the so-called Eikonal limit, also
known as the stationary phase approximation, have been used to include
first-order wave effects; however, these methods fail at Stokes lines. Stokes
lines are generic features of a variety of lens models, and are regions in
parameter space where imaginary images begin to contribute to the overall
intensity modulation of lensed sources. Using the mathematical framework of
Picard-Lefschetz theory to compute diffraction integrals, we argue that these
imaginary images contain as much information as their geometric counterparts,
and may potentially be observable in data. Thus, weak-lensing events where
these imaginary images are present can be as useful for inferring lens
parameters as strong-lensing events in which multiple geometric images are
present.

Observations of the redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) are a new
and powerful window of observation that offers us the possibility to map the
spatial distribution of cosmic HI and learn about cosmology. BINGO (Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations [BAO] from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) is a new
unique radio telescope designed to be one of the first to probe BAO at radio
frequencies. BINGO has two science goals: cosmology and astrophysics. Cosmology
is the main science goal and the driver for BINGO's design and strategy. The
key of BINGO is to detect the low redshift BAO to put strong constraints in the
dark sector models. Given the versatility of the BINGO telescope, a secondary
goal is astrophysics, where BINGO can help discover and study Fast Radio Bursts
(FRB) and other transients, Galactic and extragalactic science. In this paper,
we introduce the latest progress of the BINGO project, its science goals,
describing the scientific potential of the project in each science and the new
developments obtained by the collaboration. We introduce the BINGO project and
its science goals and give a general summary of recent developments in
construction, science potential and pipeline development obtained by the BINGO
collaboration in the past few years. We show that BINGO will be able to obtain
competitive constraints for the dark sector, and also that will allow for the
discovery of several FRBs in the southern hemisphere. The capacity of BINGO in
obtaining information from 21-cm is also tested in the pipeline introduced
here. There is still no measurement of the BAO in radio, and studying cosmology
in this new window of observations is one of the most promising advances in the
field. The BINGO project is a radio telescope that has the goal to be one of
the first to perform this measurement and it is currently being built in the
northeast of Brazil. (Abridged)

The repeating fast radio burst FRB 20200120E is located in a globular cluster
belonging to the nearby M81 galaxy. Its small distance (3.6 Mpc) and accurate
localization make it an interesting target to search for bursting activity at
high energies. From November 2003 to September 2021, the INTEGRAL satellite has
obtained an exposure time of 18 Ms on the M81 sky region. We used these data to
search for hard X-ray bursts from FRB 20200120E using the IBIS/ISGRI
instrument, without finding any significant candidate, down to an average
fluence limit of $\sim10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (20-200 keV). The corresponding
limit on the isotropic luminosity for a burst of duration $\Delta t$ is
$\sim10^{45} \left ( \frac{10~ms}{\Delta t} \right )$ erg s$^{-1}$, the deepest
limit obtained for an extragalactic FRB in the hard X-ray range. This rules out
the emission of powerful flares at a rate higher than 0.1 yr$^{-1}$ that could
be expected in models invoking young hyper-active magnetars.

The numerous compact sources associated with neutron stars and white dwarfs
discovered in recent decades are analyzed in terms of the Gravimagnetic Rotator
model (GMR paradigm - Lipunov, 1987a; Lipunov, 1992). We offer the instrument
for understanding of various observed features and evolutionary relationships
of neutron stars and white dwarfs. We depict in a single diagram all objects
from radio pulsars and dwarf novae to ultra luminous X-ray sources and a radio
pulsating white dwarf. This diagram directly demonstrates the genetic link
between different types of compact sources thereby making it possible to
confirm and illustrate clearly the established evolutionary connections - such
as that between bulge X-ray sources and millisecond pulsars. This approach
allows us to understand the evolutionary status of Ultra Luminous X-ray
sources. In addition, we propose an additional evolutionary branch of the
formation of Magnetars. When our work was completed, an article by Kirsten et
al.2021, was published, which reports the localization of FRB 20200120 in one
of the globular clusters of the galaxy M81. This shows that the
accretion-induced collapse scenario of the white dwarf (Lipunov and Postnov,
1985), considered in detail in this work, is a possible genealogical branch of
Magnetar production.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic transients with very short radio
emission. Their nature is still widely debated. I provide the first analysis of
atomic gas properties of a small sample of FRB hosts to constrain their nature.
HI observations exist for NGC 3252, the host of FRB 181030A, M81, the host of
FRB 200120E, and the Milky Way, the host of FRB 200428. I report three
observables: i) all three FRB hosts are interacting galaxies; ii) the Hi
spectra of both FRB hosts with such data available are highly asymmetric,
several standard deviations above the general population of galaxies; iii) two
FRB hosts have normal atomic gas properties and one is strongly deficient in
atomic gas. This indicates that nearby and repeating FRBs are connected with a
recent enhancement of star formation due to interaction. This supports fast FRB
channels, for example a massive star with a short delay time so that
interaction signatures giving rise to the birth of the progenitor are still
visible. Long gamma-ray burst (GRB) and broad-lined type Ic supernova (SN)
hosts exhibit much more symmetric spectra, even though they were claimed to
experience gas inflow from the intergalactic medium. The difference can be
explained by the interactions experienced by FRB hosts being more disruptive
than these gas inflows, or by the mass effect, with GRB/SN hosts at lower
masses having less organized gas motions, so with HI lines closer to a
symmetrical Gaussian. This also suggests that the emission mechanisms of FRBs
and GRBs are different.

The activity of the repeating FRB 20180916B is periodically modulated with a
period of 16.3 days, and FRB 121102 may be similarly modulated with a period of
about 160 days. In some models of this modulation the period derivative is
insensitive to the uncertain parameters; these models can be tested by
measurement of or bounds on the derivative. In other models values of the
uncertain parameters can be constrained. Periodic modulation of aperiodic
bursting activity may result from emission by a narrow beam wandering within a
cone or funnel along the axis of a precessing disc, such as the accretion discs
in X-ray binaries. The production of FRB 200428 by a neutron star that is
neither accreting nor in a binary then shows universality: coherent emission
may occur in a wide range of environments.

Magnetar hyperflares are the most plausible explanation for fast radio bursts
(FRB) -- enigmatic powerful radio pulses with durations of several milliseconds
and high brightness temperatures. The first observational evidence for this
scenario was obtained in 2020 April when a FRB was detected from the direction
of the Galactic magnetar and soft gamma-ray repeater SGR\,1935+2154. The FRB
was preceded by two gamma-ray outburst alerts by the BAT instrument aboard the
Swift satellite, which triggered follow-up observations by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). H.E.S.S. has observed SGR\,1935+2154 for 2 hr
on 2020 April 28. The observations are coincident with X-ray bursts from the
magnetar detected by INTEGRAL and Fermi-GBM, thus providing the first very high
energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of a magnetar in a flaring state.
High-quality data acquired during these follow-up observations allow us to
perform a search for short-time transients. No significant signal at energies
$E>0.6$~TeV is found and upper limits on the persistent and transient emission
are derived. We here present the analysis of these observations and discuss the
obtained results and prospects of the H.E.S.S. follow-up program for soft
gamma-ray repeaters.

The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has emerged as the
prime telescope for detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs). CHIME/FRB Outriggers
will be a dedicated very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) instrument
consisting of outrigger telescopes at continental baselines working with CHIME
and its specialized real-time transient-search backend (CHIME/FRB) to detect
and localize FRBs with 50 mas precision. In this paper we present a minimally
invasive clock stabilization system that effectively transfers the CHIME
digital backend reference clock from its original GPS-disciplined ovenized
crystal oscillator to a passive hydrogen maser. This enables us to combine the
long-term stability and absolute time tagging of the GPS clock with the short
and intermediate-term stability of the maser to reduce the clock timing errors
between VLBI calibration observations. We validate the system with VLBI-style
observations of Cygnus A over a 400 m baseline between CHIME and the CHIME
Pathfinder, demonstrating agreement between sky-based and maser-based timing
measurements at the 30 ps rms level on timescales ranging from one minute to up
to nine days, and meeting the stability requirements for CHIME/FRB Outriggers.
In addition, we present an alternate reference clock solution for outrigger
stations which lack the infrastructure to support a passive hydrogen maser.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio flashes of unknown physical
origin. Their high luminosities and short durations require extreme energy
densities, like those found in the vicinity of neutron stars and black holes.
Studying the burst intensities and polarimetric properties on a wide range of
timescales, from milliseconds down to nanoseconds, is key to understanding the
emission mechanism. However, high-time-resolution studies of FRBs are limited
by their unpredictable activity levels, available instrumentation and temporal
broadening in the intervening ionised medium. Here we show that the repeating
FRB 20200120E can produce isolated shots of emission as short as about 60
nanoseconds in duration, with brightness temperatures as high as $3\times
10^{41}$ K (excluding relativistic effects), comparable to `nano-shots' from
the Crab pulsar. Comparing both the range of timescales and luminosities, we
find that FRB 20200120E observationally bridges the gap between known Galactic
young pulsars and magnetars, and the much more distant extragalactic FRBs. This
suggests a common magnetically powered emission mechanism spanning many orders
of magnitude in timescale and luminosity. In this work, we probe a relatively
unexplored region of the short-duration transient phase space; we highlight
that there likely exists a population of ultra-fast radio transients at
nanosecond to microsecond timescales, which current FRB searches are
insensitive to.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are exceptionally luminous flashes of unknown
physical origin, reaching us from other galaxies (Petroff et al. 2019). Most
FRBs have only ever been seen once, while others flash repeatedly, though
sporadically (Spitler et al. 2016, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021). Many
models invoke magnetically powered neutron stars (magnetars) as the engines
producing FRB emission (Margalit & Metzger 2018, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.
2020). Recently, CHIME/FRB announced the discovery (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) of
the repeating FRB 20200120E, coming from the direction of the nearby grand
design spiral galaxy M81. Four potential counterparts at other observing
wavelengths were identified (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) but no definitive
association with these sources, or M81, could be made. Here we report an
extremely precise localisation of FRB 20200120E, which allows us to associate
it with a globular cluster (GC) in the M81 galactic system and to place it ~2pc
offset from the optical center of light of the GC. This confirms (Bhardwaj et
al. 2021) that FRB 20200120E is 40 times closer than any other known
extragalactic FRB. Because such GCs host old stellar populations, this
association strongly challenges FRB models that invoke young magnetars formed
in a core-collapse supernova as powering FRB emission. We propose, instead,
that FRB 20200120E is a highly magnetised neutron star formed via either
accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf or via merger of compact stars in a
binary system (Margalit et al. 2019). Alternative scenarios involving compact
binary systems, efficiently formed inside globular clusters, could also be
responsible for the observed bursts.

We present the detection of a bright radio burst at radio frequencies between
2.2--2.3 GHz with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) 70 m dish (DSS-63) in
Madrid, Spain from FRB~20200120E. This repeating fast radio burst (FRB) was
recently discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast
Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) instrument and reported to be associated with the M81
spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The high time resolution capabilities
of the recording system used in this observation, together with the small
amount of scattering and intrinsic brightness of the burst, allow us to explore
the burst structure in unprecedented detail. We find that the burst has a
duration of roughly 30 $\mu$s and is comprised of several narrow components
with typical separations of 2--3 $\mu$s. The narrowest component has a width of
$\lesssim$ 100 ns, which corresponds to a light travel time size as small as 30
m, the smallest associated with an FRB to date. The peak flux density of the
narrowest burst component is 270 Jy. We estimate the total spectral luminosity
of the narrowest component of the burst to be 4 $\times$ 10$^{\text{30}}$ erg
s$^{\text{-1}}$ Hz$^{\text{-1}}$, which is a factor of $\sim$500 above the
luminosities of the so-called "nanoshots" associated with giant pulses from the
Crab pulsar. This spectral luminosity is also higher than that of the radio
bursts detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 during its outburst in
April 2020, but it falls on the low-end of the currently measured luminosity
distribution of extragalatic FRBs. These results provide further support for
the presence of a continuum of FRB burst luminosities.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising tool for studying the low-density
universe as their dispersion measures (DM) are extremely sensitive probes of
electron column density. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) inject energy into the
intergalactic medium, affecting the DM and its scatter. To determine the
effectiveness of FRBs as a probe of AGN feedback, we analysed three different
AGN models from the EAGLE simulation series. We measured the mean DM-redshift
relation, and the scatter around it, using $2.56 \times 10^8$ sightlines at 131
redshift ($z$) bins between $0 \leq z \leq 3$. While the DM-redshift relation
itself is highly robust against different AGN feedback models, significant
differences are detected in the scatter around the mean: weaker feedback leads
to more scatter. We find $\sim 10^4$ localised FRBs are needed to discriminate
between the scatter in standard feedback and stronger, more intermittent
feedback models. The number of FRBs required is dependent on the redshift
distribution of the detected population. A log-normal redshift distribution at
$z=0.5$ requires approximately 50% fewer localised FRBs than a distribution
centred at $z=1$. With the Square Kilometre Array expected to detect $>10^3$
FRBs per day, in the future, FRBs will be able to provide constraints on AGN
feedback.

Recent observations have shown that repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
exhibit band-limited emission, whose frequency-dependent amplitude can be
modeled using a Gaussian function. In this analysis, we show that banded
emission of FRBs can lead to incompleteness across the observing band. This
biases the detected sample of bursts and can explain the various shapes of
cumulative energy distributions seen for repeating FRBs. We assume a Gaussian
shape of the burst spectra and used simulations to demonstrate the above bias
using an FRB 121102-like example. We recovered energy distributions that showed
a break in power-law and flattening of power-law at low energies, based on the
fluence threshold of the observations. We provide recommendations for
single-pulse searches and analysis of repeating FRBs to account for this
incompleteness. Primarily, we recommend that burst spectra should be modeled to
estimate the intrinsic fluence and bandwidth of the burst robustly. Also,
bursts that lie mainly within the observing band should be used for analyses of
energy distributions. We show that the bimodality reported in the distribution
of energies of FRB 121102 by Li et al. (2021) disappears when burst bandwidth,
instead of the center frequency of the observation, is used to estimate energy.
Sub-banded searches will also aid in detecting band-limited bursts. All the
analysis scripts used in this work are available in a Github repository.

The energy and waiting time distributions are important properties for
understanding the physical mechanism of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs).
Recently, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
detected the largest burst sample of FRB 121102, containing 1652 bursts. We use
this sample to investigate the energy and waiting time distributions. The
energy count distribution $dN/dE$ at the high-energy range ($>10^{38}$ erg) can
be fitted with a single power-law function with an index of $-1.86
^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, while the distribution at the low-energy range deviates from
the power-law function. An interesting result of Li et al. (2021) is that there
is an apparent temporal gap between early bursts (occurring before MJD 58740)
and late bursts (occurring after MJD 58740). We find the energy distributions
of high-energy bursts at different epochs are inconsistent. The power-law index
is $-1.70^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ for early bursts and $-2.60^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ for
late bursts. For bursts observed in a single day, a linear repetition pattern
is found. We use the Weibull function to fit the distribution of waiting time
of consecutive bursts. The shape parameter $k = 0.72^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and the
event rate $r = 736.43^{+26.55}_{-28.90}$ day$ ^{-1} $ are derived. If the
waiting times with $\delta_t < 28$ s are excluded, the burst behavior can be
described by a Poisson process. The best-fitting values of $k$ are slightly
different for low-energy ($E < 1.58\times10^{38}$ erg) and high-energy ($E >
1.58\times10^{38}$ erg) bursts.

We present the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)
localization and follow-up observations of the host galaxy of the repeating
fast radio burst (FRB) source, FRB20201124A, the fifth such extragalactic
repeating FRB with an identified host. From spectroscopic observations using
the 6.5-m MMT Observatory, we derive a redshift of $z=0.0979 \pm 0.0001$, a
star formation rate inferred from H$\alpha$ emission of SFR(H$\alpha$) $\approx
2.1 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and a gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H)$\approx
9.0$. By jointly modeling the 12-filter optical-mid-infrared (MIR) photometry
and spectroscopy of the host, we infer a median stellar mass of $\approx 2
\times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, internal dust extinction of $A_V\approx 1-1.5$ mag,
and a mass-weighted stellar population age of $\approx 5-6$ Gyr. Connecting
these data to the radio and X-ray observations, we cannot reconcile the
broad-band behavior with strong AGN activity and instead attribute the dominant
source of persistent radio emission to star formation, likely originating from
the circumnuclear region of the host. The modeling also indicates a hot dust
component contributing to the MIR luminosity at a level of $\approx 10-30\%$.
We model the host galaxy's star formation and mass assembly histories, finding
that the host assembled $>90\%$ of its mass by 1 Gyr ago and exhibited a fairly
constant SFR for most of its existence, with no clear evidence of past
star-burst activity.

We used a new spectral-fitting technique to identify a subpopulation of 6
narrow-band giant pulses from the Crab pulsar out of a total of 1578. These
giant pulses were detected in 77 minutes of observations with the 46-m dish at
the Algonquin Radio Observatory at 400-800 MHz. The narrow-band giant pulses
consist of both main- and inter-pulses, thereby being more likely to be caused
by an intrinsic emission mechanism as opposed to a propagation effect. Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs) have demonstrated similar narrow-band features while only
little has been observed in the giant pulses of pulsars. We report the
narrow-band giant pulses with $\Delta \nu / \nu$ on the order of 0.1, which is
close to the value of 0.05 reported for the repeater FRB 20190711A. Hence, the
connection between FRBs and giant pulses of pulsars is further established.

We present an analysis of a densely repeating sample of bursts from the first
repeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102. We reanalysed the data used by Gourdji
et al. (2019) and detected 93 additional bursts using our single-pulse search
pipeline. In total, we detected 133 bursts in three hours of data at a center
frequency of 1.4 GHz using the Arecibo telescope, and develop robust modeling
strategies to constrain the spectro-temporal properties of all the bursts in
the sample. Most of the burst profiles show a scattering tail, and burst
spectra are well modeled by a Gaussian with a median width of 230 MHz. We find
a lack of emission below 1300 MHz, consistent with previous studies of FRB
121102. We also find that the peak of the log-normal distribution of wait times
decreases from 207 s to 75 s using our larger sample of bursts, as compared to
that of Gourdji et al. (2019). Our observations do not favor either Poissonian
or Weibull distributions for the burst rate distribution. We searched for
periodicity in the bursts using multiple techniques but did not detect any
significant period. The cumulative burst energy distribution exhibits a broken
power-law shape, with the lower and higher-energy slopes of $-0.4\pm0.1$ and
$-1.8\pm0.2$, with the break at $(2.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{37}$ ergs. We provide
our burst fitting routines as a python package BURSTFIT that can be used to
model the spectrogram of any complex FRB or pulsar pulse using robust fitting
techniques. All the other analysis scripts and results are publicly available.

Observation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are rising very quickly with the
advent of specialised instruments and surveys, and it has recently been shown
that some of them repeat quasi-periodically. In particular, evidence of a
$P=16.35$ day period has been reported for FRB 180916.J0158+65. We seek an
explanation within the frame of our orbiting asteroid model, whereby FRBs are
produced in the plasma wake of asteroids immersed in the wind of a pulsar or a
magnetar. We used the data reported by the CHIME/FRB collaboration in order to
infer the orbital characteristics of asteroid swarms, and performed parametric
studies to explore the possible characteristics of the pulsar, its wind, and of
the asteroids, under the constraint that the latter remain dynamically and
thermally stable. We found a plausible configuration in which a young pulsar is
orbited by a main $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ companion with a period $3P = 49$d,
three times longer than the apparent periodicity $P$. Asteroids responsible for
FRBs are located in three dynamical swarms near the L3, L4 and L5 Lagrange
points, in a 2:3 orbital resonance akin to the Hildas class of asteroids in the
Solar system. In addition, asteroids could be present in the Trojan swarms at
the L4 and L5 Lagrange points. Together these swarms form a carousel that
explains the apparent $P$ periodicity and dispersion. We estimated that the
presence of at least a few thousand asteroids, of size $\sim20$km, is necessary
to produce the observed burst rate. We show how radius-to-frequency mapping in
the wind and small perturbations by turbulence can suffice to explain
downward-drifting sub-pulses, micro-structures, and narrow spectral occupancy.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most exciting new mysteries of
astrophysics. Their origin is still unknown, but recent observations seems to
link them to Soft Gamma Repeaters and, in particular, to magnetar giant flares
(MGFs). The recent detection of a MGF at GeV energies by the \textit{Fermi}
Large Area Telescope (LAT) motivated the search for GeV counterparts to the
>100 currently known FRBs. Taking advantage of more than 12 years of
\textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we perform a search for gamma-ray emission from all
the reported repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We analyse on different-time
scales the \textit{Fermi}-LAT data of each individual source separately,
including a cumulative analysis on the repeating ones. In addition, we perform
the first stacking analysis at GeV energies of this class of sources in order
to constrain the gamma-ray properties of the FRBs that are undetected at high
energies. The stacking analysis is a powerful method that allow a possible
detection from below-threshold FRBs providing important information on these
objects. In this talk we present the preliminary results of our study and we
discuss their implications for the predictions of gamma-ray emission from this
class of sources

We report on the results of multi-wavelength follow-up observations with
Gemini, VLA, and ATCA, to search for a host galaxy and any persistent radio
emission associated with FRB 180309. This FRB is among the most luminous FRB
detections to date, with a luminosity of $> 8.7\times 10^{32}$ erg Hz$^{-1}$ at
the dispersion-based redshift upper limit of 0.32. We used the
high-significance detection of FRB 180309 with the Parkes Telescope and a beam
model of the Parkes Multibeam Receiver to improve the localization of the FRB
to a region spanning approximately $\sim2'\times2'$. We aimed to seek bright
galaxies within this region to determine the strongest candidates as the
originator of this highly luminous FRB. We identified optical sources within
the localization region above our r-band magnitude limit of 24.27, fourteen of
which have photometric redshifts whose fitted mean is consistent with the
redshift upper limit ($z < 0.32$) of our FRB. Two of these galaxies are
coincident with marginally detected "persistent" radio sources of flux density
24.3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and 22.1$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ respectively. Our
redshift-dependent limit on the luminosity of any associated persistent radio
source is comparable to the luminosity limits for other localized FRBs. We
analyze several properties of the candidate hosts we identified, including
chance association probability, redshift, and presence of radio emission,
however it remains possible that any of these galaxies could be the host of
this FRB. Follow-up spectroscopy on these objects to explore their H$\alpha$
emission and ionization contents, as well as to obtain more precisely measured
redshifts, may be able to isolate a single host for this luminous FRB.

As the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has become the
leading instrument for detecting Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), CHIME/FRB Outriggers
will use very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) to localize FRBs with
milliarcsecond precision. The CHIME site uses a passive hydrogen maser
frequency standard in order to minimize localization errors due to clock delay.
However, not all outrigger stations will have access to a maser. This report
presents techniques used to evaluate clocks for use at outrigger sites without
a maser. More importantly, the resulting algorithm provides calibration methods
for clocks that do not initially meet the stability requirements for VLBI, thus
allowing CHIME/FRB Outriggers to remain true to the goal of having
milliarcsecond precision.

We consider a sample of $82$ non-repeating FRBs detected at Parkes, ASKAP,
CHIME and UTMOST each of which operates over a different frequency range and
has a different detection criteria. Using simulations, we perform a maximum
likelihood analysis to determine the FRB population model which best fits this
data. Our analysis shows that models where the pulse scatter broadening
increases moderately with redshift ($z$) are preferred over those where this
increases very sharply or where scattering is absent. Further, models where the
comoving event rate density is constant over $z$ are preferred over those where
it follows the cosmological star formation rate. Two models for the host
dispersion measure ($DM_{\rm host}$) distribution (a fixed and a random
$DM_{\rm host}$) are found to predict comparable results. We obtain the best
fit parameter values $\alpha=-1.53^{+0.29}_{-0.19}$,
$\overline{E}_{33}=1.55^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and $\gamma=0.77\pm 0.24$. Here
$\alpha$ is the spectral index, $\gamma$ is the exponent of the Schechter
luminosity function and $\overline{E}_{33}$ is the mean FRB energy in units of
$10^{33} \, {\rm J}$ across $2128 - 2848\; {\rm MHz}$ in the FRB rest frame.

The recent discovery of a Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) associated with a
hard X-ray burst from the soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) J1935+2154 has
established the magnetar origin of at least some FRBs. In this work, we study
the statistical properties of soft gamma-/hard X-ray bursts from SGRs 1806--20
and J1935+2154 and of radio bursts from the repeating FRB 121102. For SGRs, we
show that the probability density functions for the differences of fluences,
fluxes, and durations at different times have fat tails with a $q$-Gaussian
form. The $q$ values in the $q$-Gaussian distributions are approximately steady
and independent of the temporal interval scale adopted, implying a
scale-invariant structure of SGRs. These features indicate that SGR bursts may
be governed by a self-organizing criticality (SOC) process, confirming previous
findings. Very recently, 1652 independent bursts from FRB 121102 have been
detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).
Here we also investigate the scale-invariant structure of FRB 121102 based on
the latest observations of FAST, and show that FRB 121102 and SGRs share
similar statistical properties. Given the bimodal energy distribution of FRB
121102 bursts, we separately explore the scale-invariant behaviors of low- and
high-energy bursts of FRB 121102. We find that the $q$ values of low- and
high-energy bursts are different, which further strengthens the evidence of the
bimodality of the energy distribution. Scale invariance in both the high-energy
component of FRB 121102 and SGRs can be well explained within the same physical
framework of fractal-diffusive SOC systems.

Magnetars, the likely sources of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), produce both
steady highly relativistic magnetized winds, and occasional ejection events. We
demonstrate that the requirement of conservation of the magnetic flux dominates
the overall dynamics of magnetic explosions. This is missed in conventional
hydrodynamic models of the ejections as expanding shell with parametrically
added magnetic field, as well as one-dimensional models of magnetic
disturbances. Most of the initial free energy of an explosion is actually spent
on stretching its own internal magnetic field, while doing minimal $pdV$ work
against the surrounding. Magnetic explosions from magnetars come into force
balance with the pre-flares wind close to the light cylinder. They are then
advected quietly with the wind, or propagate as electromagnetic disturbances.
No powerful shock waves are generated in the wind.

When does the presence of an outlier in some measured property indicate that
the outlying object differs qualitatively, rather than quantitatively, from
other members of its apparent class? Historical examples include the many types
of supernov\ae\ and short {\it vs.\/} long Gamma Ray Bursts. There may be only
one parameter and one outlier, so that principal component analyses are
inapplicable. A qualitative difference implies that some parameter has a
characteristic scale, and hence its distribution cannot be a power law (that
can have no such scale). If the distribution is a power law the objects differ
only quantitatively. The applicability of a power law to an empirical
distribution may be tested by comparing the most extreme member to its
next-most extreme. The probability distribution of their ratio is calculated,
and compared to data for stars, radio and X-ray sources, and the fluxes,
fluences and rotation measures of Fast Radio Bursts. It is found with high
statistical significance that the giant outburst of soft gamma repeater SGR
1806-20 differed qualitatively from its lesser outbursts and FRB 200428
differed qualitatively from other FRB (by location in the Galaxy), but that in
some supernova remnant models of rotation measure FRB 121102 is not,
statistically significantly, an outlier.

We have searched for weak fast radio burst (FRB) events using a database
containing 568,736,756 transient events detected using the Parkes radio
telescope between 1997 and 2001. In order to classify these pulses, and to
identify likely FRB candidates, we used a machine learning algorithm based on
ResNet. We identified 81 new candidate FRBs and provide details of their
positions, event times, and dispersion measures. These events were detected in
only one beam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. We used a relatively low S/N
cutoff threshold when selecting these bursts and some have dispersion measures
only slightly exceeding the expected Galactic contribution. We therefore
present these candidate FRBs as a guide for follow-up observations in the
search for repeating FRBs.

The axion objects such as axion mini-clusters and axion clouds around
spinning black holes induce parametric resonances of electromagnetic waves
through the axion-photon interaction. In particular, it has been known that the
resonances from the axion with the mass around $10^{-6}$eV may explain the
observed fast radio bursts (FRBs). Here we argue that similar bursts of high
frequency gravitational waves, which we call the fast gravitational wave bursts
(FGBs), are generated from axion clumps with the presence of gravitational
Chern-Simons (CS) coupling. The typical frequency is half of the axion mass,
which in general can range from kHz to GHz. We also discuss the secondary
gravitational wave production associated with FRB, as well as the possible host
objects of the axion clouds, such as primordial black holes with typical masses
around $10^{-5}M_{\odot}$. Future detections of FGBs together with the observed
FRBs are expected to provide more evidence for the axion.

We report on the host association of FRB 20181030A, a repeating fast radio
burst (FRB) with a low dispersion measure (DM, 103.5 pc cm$^{-3}$) discovered
by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2019a). Using baseband voltage data saved
for its repeat bursts, we localize the FRB to a sky area of 5.3 sq. arcmin (90%
confidence). Within the FRB localization region, we identify NGC 3252 as the
most promising host, with an estimated chance coincidence probability $< 2.5
\times 10^{-3}$. Moreover, we do not find any other galaxy with M$_{r} < -15$
AB mag within the localization region to the maximum estimated FRB redshift of
0.05. This rules out a dwarf host 5 times less luminous than any FRB host
discovered to date. NGC 3252 is a star-forming spiral galaxy, and at a distance
of $\approx$ 20 Mpc, it is one of the closest FRB hosts discovered thus far.
From our archival radio data search, we estimate a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the
luminosity of a persistent compact radio source (source size $<$ 0.3 kpc at 20
Mpc) at 3 GHz to be ${\rm 2 \times 10^{26} erg~s^{-1} Hz^{-1}}$, at least 1500
times smaller than that of the FRB 20121102A persistent radio source. We also
argue that a population of young millisecond magnetars alone cannot explain the
observed volumetric rate of repeating FRBs. Finally, FRB 20181030A is a
promising source for constraining FRB emission models due to its proximity, and
we strongly encourage its multi-wavelength follow-up.

Modern radio interferometers such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) are
capable of producing data at hundreds of gigabits to terabits per second. This
high data rate makes the analysis of radio data cumbersome and computationally
expensive. While high performance computing facilities exist for large national
and international facilities, that may not be the case for instruments operated
by a single institution or a small consortium. Data rates for next generation
radio telescopes are set to eclipse those currently in operation, hence local
processing of data will become all the more important. Here, we introduce the
REAL-time Transient Acquisition backend (REALTA), a computing backend at the
Irish LOFAR station (I-LOFAR) which facilitates the recording of data in near
real-time and post-processing. We also present first searches and scientific
results of a number of radio phenomena observed by I-LOFAR and REALTA,
including pulsars, fast radio bursts (FRBs), rotating radio transients (RRATs),
the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), Jupiter, and the Sun.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with short durations and
extremely high brightness temperatures, and their physical origins are still
unknown. Recently, a repeating source, FRB 20200120E, was found in a globular
cluster in the very nearby M81 galaxy. The associated globular cluster has an
age of $\sim9.13~{\rm Gyr}$, and hosts an old population of stars. In this
work, we consider that an FRB source is in a close binary system with a
low-mass main sequence star as its companion. Due to the large burst energy of
the FRB, when the companion star stops the FRB, its surface would be heated by
the radiation-induced shock, and make re-emission. For a binary system with a
solar-like companion star and an orbital period of a few days, we find that the
re-emission is mainly at optical band, and with delays of a few seconds after
the FRB. Its luminosity is several times larger than the solar luminosity, and
the duration is about hundreds of seconds. Such a transient might be observable
in the future multiwavelength follow-up observation for Galactic FRB sources.

We present a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project
between 400 and 800 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 July 1, including 62 bursts
from 18 previously reported repeating sources. The catalog represents the first
large sample, including bursts from repeaters and non-repeaters, observed in a
single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and
absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent
non-repeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are
consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from
repeating sources differ from apparent non-repeaters in intrinsic temporal
width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our
detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to
account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs -
comprising a large fraction of the overall population - with a scattering time
at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by
CHIME/FRB. We infer a power-law index for the cumulative fluence distribution
of $\alpha=-1.40\pm0.11(\textrm{stat.})^{+0.06}_{-0.09}(\textrm{sys.})$,
consistent with the $-3/2$ expectation for a non-evolving population in
Euclidean space. We find $\alpha$ is steeper for high-DM events and shallower
for low-DM events, which is what would be expected when DM is correlated with
distance. We infer a sky rate of
$[820\pm60(\textrm{stat.})^{+220}_{-200}({\textrm{sys.}})]/\textrm{sky}/\textrm{day}$
above a fluence of 5 Jy ms at 600 MHz, with scattering time at $600$ MHz under
10 ms, and DM above 100 pc cm$^{-3}$.

Fast Radio Burst (FRB) dispersion measures (DMs) record the presence of
ionized baryons that are otherwise invisible to other techniques enabling
resolution of the matter distribution in the cosmic web. In this work, we aim
to estimate the contribution to FRB 180924 DM from foreground galactic halos.
Localized by ASKAP to a massive galaxy, this sightline is notable for an
estimated cosmic web contribution to the DM ($\rm DM_{cosmic} =
220~pc~cm^{-3}$), which is less than the average value at the host redshift
($\rm z = 0.3216$) estimated from the Macquart relation ($280~\rm pc~cm^{-3}$).
In the favored models of the cosmic web, this suggests few intersections with
foreground halos at small impact parameters ($\lesssim 100$ kpc). To test this
hypothesis, we carried out spectroscopic observations of the field galaxies
within $\sim$1' of the sightline with VLT/MUSE and Keck/LRIS. Furthermore, we
developed a probabilistic methodology that leverages photometric redshifts
derived from wide-field DES and WISE imaging. We conclude that there is no
galactic halo that closely intersects the sightline and also that the net DM
contribution from halos, $\rm DM_{halos}< 45~pc~cm^{-3}$ (95 % c.l.). This
value is lower than the $\rm DM_{halos}$ estimated from an "average" sightline
($121~\rm pc~cm^{-3}$) using the Planck $\Lambda CDM$ model and the Aemulus
halo mass function and reasonably explains its low $\rm DM_{cosmic}$ value. We
conclude that FRB 180924 represents the predicted majority of sightlines in the
universe with no proximate foreground galactic halos. Our framework lays the
foundation for a comprehensive analysis of FRB fields in the near future.

Fast radio burst (FRBs) are an exciting class of bright, extragalactic,
millisecond radio transients. The recent development of large field-of-view
(FOV) radio telescopes has caused a rapid rise in the number of identified
single burst and repeating FRBs. This has allowed for the extensive
multi-wavelength follow-up to search for the potential counterparts predicted
by theoretical models. New observations of similar radio transients in Galactic
magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 have continued to motivate the search for rapid
optical and very-high-energy (VHE, >100 GeV) counterparts. Since 2016 VERITAS
has engaged in an FRB observing campaign to search for the prompt optical, and
VHE emission from multiple repeating FRBs. We present these new results from
VERITAS observations of five repeating sources including data taken
simultaneously with bursts observed by the CHIME radio telescope.

A repeating fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 20180916B (hereafter FRB 180916), was
reported to have a 16.35-day period. This period might be related to a
precession period. In this paper, we investigate two precession models to
explain the periodic activity of FRB 180916. In both models, the radio emission
of FRB 180916 is produced by a precessing jet. For the first disk-driven jet
precession model, an extremely low viscous parameter (i.e., the dimensionless
viscosity parameter $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-8}$) is required to explain the
precession of FRB 180916, which implies its implausibility. For the second
tidal force-driven jet precession model, we consider a compact binary consists
of a neutron star/black hole and a white dwarf; the white dwarf fills its Roche
lobe and mass transfer occurs. Due to the misalignment between the disk and
orbital plane, the tidal force of the white dwarf can drive jet precession. We
show that the relevant precession periods are several days to hundreds of days,
depending on the specific accretion rates and component masses. The duration of
FRB 180916 generation in the binary with extremely high accretion rate will be
several thousand years.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06066v4
Most Fast Radio Burst (FRB) models are built from comparatively common
astronomical objects: neutron stars, black holes and supernova remnants. Yet
FRB sources are rare, and most of these objects, found in the Galaxy, do not
make FRB. Special and rare circumstances may be required for these common
objects to be sources of FRB. The recent discovery of a repeating FRB in a
globular cluster belonging to the galaxy M81 suggests a model involving a
neutron star and a close binary companion, likely a white dwarf; both neutron
stars and close binaries are superabundant in globular clusters. Magnetic
interaction is a plausible, though unproven, mechanism of acceleration of
relativistic particles that may radiate coherently as FRB. Double neutron star
binaries cannot be the observed long-lived repeating FRB sources, but might
make much shorter lived sources, and perhaps non-repeating FRB.

Photon is the fundamental quantum of electromagnetic fields, whose mass,
$m_{\gamma}$, should be strictly zero in Maxwell's theory. But not all theories
adopt this hypothesis. If the rest mass of the photon is not zero, there will
be an additional time delay between photons of different frequencies after they
travel through a fixed distance. By analyzing the time delay, we can measure or
constrain the photon mass. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- transient radio bursts
characterized by millisecond duration and cosmological propagation -- are
excellent astrophysical laboratories to constrain $m_{\gamma}$. In this work we
use a catalog of 129 FRBs in a Bayesian framework to constrain $m_{\gamma}$. As
a result, we obtain a new bound on the photon mass, $m_{\gamma} \leq 3.1\times
10^{-51}\rm\,kg\simeq 1.7 \times 10^{-15}\,eV/c^2$ ($m_{\gamma} \leq 3.9\times
10^{-51}\rm\,kg \simeq 2.2 \times 10^{-15}\,eV/c^2$) at the $68\%$ $(95\%$)
confidence level. The result represents the best limit purely from kinematic
analysis of light propagation. The bound on the photon mass will be tighter in
the near future with increment in the number of FRBs, more accurate measurement
of the redshift for FRBs, and refinement in the knowledge about the origin of
dispersion measures (DMs).

Multi-wavelength simultaneous observations are essential to the constraints
on the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, it is a significant
observational challenge due to the nature of FRBs as transients with a radio
millisecond duration, which occur randomly in the sky regardless of time and
position. Here, we report the search for short-time fast optical bursts in the
GWAC archived data associated with FRB 20181130B, which were detected by the
Five Hundred Meter Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and recently reported. No
new credible sources were detected in all single GWAC images with an exposure
time of 10 s, including image with coverage of the expected arrival time in
optical wavelength by taking the high dispersion measurements into account. Our
results provide a limiting magnitude of 15.43$\pm0.04$ mag in R band,
corresponding to a flux density of 1.66 Jy or 8.35 mag in AB system by assuming
that the duration of the optical band is similar to that of the radio band of
about 10 ms. This limiting magnitude makes the spectral index of $\alpha<0.367$
from optical to radio wavelength. The possible existence of longer duration
optical emission was also investigated with an upper limits of 0.33 Jy (10.10
mag), 1.74 mJy (15.80 mag) and 0.16 mJy (18.39 mag) for the duration of 50 ms,
10 s and 6060 s, respectively. This undetected scenario could be partially
attributed to the shallow detection capability, as well as the high inferred
distance of FRB 20181130B and the low fluence in radio wavelength. The future
detectability of optical flashes associated with nearby and bright FRBs are
also discussed in this paper.

High brightness temperature radio transients such as pulsars and fast radio
bursts require the coherent radiation of particles. The antenna class of
coherent radiation models require a large number of charged particles radiating
in phase, therefore the particles must be spatially confined and have
well-aligned velocities. Given these necessary conditions, we look at the
magnetic field induced by the currents associated with coherently emitting
accelerated particles and consider the interaction between the radiating
particles and the induced magnetic field. We find a maximum luminosity of
coherent curvature radiation that depends on source parameters such as surface
magnetic field and neutron star spin period. We find that coherent radio
emission across all luminosities can be explained by coherent curvature
radiation and suggest it could be universally responsible for both FRBs and
extreme galactic sources. Using the Crab Pulsar as an example, we constrain the
emission parameters and origin of the most extreme nanoshots to within 60km of
the pulsar surface assuming coherent curvature radiation. In agreement with
recent observations, we also predict simultaneous X-ray emission from
small-scale particle gyration due to the induced field.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04414v2
We discuss constraints that the observed brightness temperatures impose on
coherent processes in pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and in particular
on the hypothesis of coherent curvature emission by bunches. We estimate the
peak brightness temperature that a bunch of charge $Ze$ can produce via
synchrotron and/or curvature emission as $k_B T \sim (Z e)^2/\lambda$, where
$\lambda$ is the typical emitted wavelength. We demonstrate that the bunch's
electrostatic energy required to produce observed brightness temperature is
prohibitively high, of the order of the total {\it bulk } energy. We compare
corresponding requirements for the Free Electron Laser mechanism (Lyutikov
2021) and find that in that case the constraints are much easier satisfied.

Fast radio bursts (FRB) are enigmatic powerful single radio pulses with
durations of several milliseconds and high brightness temperatures suggesting
coherent emission mechanism. For the time being a number of extragalactic FRBs
have been detected in the high-frequency radio band including repeating ones.
The most plausible explanation for these phenomena is magnetar hyperflares. The
first observational evidence of this scenario was obtained in April 2020 when
an FRB was detected from the direction of the Galactic magnetar and soft gamma
repeater SGR1935+2154. The FRB was preceded with a number of soft gamma-ray
bursts observed by Swift-BAT satellite, which triggered the follow-up program
of the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). H.E.S.S. has
observed SGR1935+2154 over a 2 hour window few hours prior to the FRB detection
by STARE2 and CHIME. The observations overlapped with other X-ray bursts from
the magnetar detected by INTEGRAL and Swift-BAT, thus providing first
observations of a magnetar in a flaring state in the very-high energy domain.
We present the analysis of these observations, discuss the obtained results and
prospects of the H.E.S.S. follow-up program for soft gamma repeaters and
anomalous X-ray pulsars.

The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) localized to a globular cluster in M81
challenges our understanding of FRB models. In this Letter, we explore
dynamical formation scenarios for objects in old globular clusters that may
plausibly power FRBs. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that young
neutron stars may form in globular clusters at a rate of up to
$\sim50\,\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ through a combination of binary white
dwarf mergers, white dwarf--neutron star mergers, binary neutron star mergers,
and accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs in binary systems. We
consider two FRB emission mechanisms: First, we show that a
magnetically-powered source (e.g., a magnetar with field strength
$\gtrsim10^{14}\,$G) is viable for radio emission efficiencies
$\gtrsim10^{-4}$. This would require magnetic activity lifetimes longer than
the associated spin-down timescales and longer than empirically-constrained
lifetimes of Galactic magnetars. Alternatively, if these dynamical formation
channels produce young rotation-powered neutron stars with spin periods of
$\sim10\,$ms and magnetic fields of $\sim10^{11}\,$G (corresponding to
spin-down lifetimes of $\gtrsim10^5\,$yr), the inferred event rate and
energetics can be reasonably reproduced for order unity duty cycles.
Additionally, we show that recycled millisecond pulsars or low-mass X-ray
binaries similar to those well-observed in Galactic globular clusters may also
be plausible channels, but only if their duty cycle for producing bursts
similar to the M81 FRB is small.

Fast spinning (e.g., sub-second) neutron star with ultra-strong magnetic
fields (or so-called magnetar) is one of the promising origins of repeating
fast radio bursts (FRBs). Here we discuss circularly polarised emissions
produced by propagation effects in the magnetosphere of fast spinning
magnetars. We argue that the polarisation-limiting region is well beyond the
light cylinder, suggesting that wave mode coupling effects are unlikely to
produce strong circular polarisation for fast spinning magnetars. Cyclotron
absorption could be significant if the secondary plasma density is high.
However, high degrees of circular polarisation can only be produced with large
asymmetries in electrons and positrons. We draw attention to the non-detection
of circular polarisation in current observations of known repeating FRBs. We
suggest that the circular polarisation of FRBs could provide key information on
their origins and help distinguish different radiation mechanisms.

Since their serendipitous discovery, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have garnered a
great deal of attention from both observers and theorists. A new class of radio
telescopes with wide fields of view have enabled a rapid accumulation of FRB
observations, confirming that FRBs originate from cosmological distances. The
high occurrence rate of FRBs and the development of new instruments to observe
them create opportunities for FRBs to be utilized for a host of astrophysical
and cosmological studies. We focus on the rare, and as yet undetected, subset
of FRBs that undergo repeated bursts and are strongly gravitationally lensed by
intervening structure. An extremely precise timing of burst arrival times is
possible for strongly lensed repeating FRBs, and we show how this timing
precision enables the search for long wavelength gravitational waves, including
those sourced by supermassive black hole binary systems. The timing of burst
arrival for strongly lensed repeating FRBs is sensitive to gravitational wave
sources near the FRB host galaxy, which may lie at cosmological distances and
would therefore be extremely challenging to detect by other means. Timing of
strongly lensed FRBs can also be combined with pulsar timing array data to
search for correlated time delays characteristic of gravitational waves passing
through the Earth.

The frequency-dependent periodic active window of the fast radio burst FRB
180916.J0158+65 (FRB 180916B) was observed recently. In this Letter, we propose
that a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) system, which is composed of a neutron star (NS)
and a Be star with a circumstellar disk, might be the source of a repeating FRB
with periodic activities, and apply this model to explain the activity window
of FRB 180916B. The interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the accreted
material results in evolution of the spin period and the centrifugal force of
the NS, leading to the change of the stress in the NS crust. When the stress of
the crust reaches the critical value, a starquake occurs and further produces
FRBs. The interval between starquakes is estimated to be a few days that is
smaller than the active window of FRB 180916B. When the NS moves out of the
disk of the Be star, the interval between starquakes becomes much longer than
the orbital period, which corresponds to the non-active phase. In this model,
due to the absorption of the disk of the Be star, a frequency-dependent active
window would appear for the FRBs, which is consistent with the observed
properties of FRB 180916B. And the contribution of dispersion measure (DM) from
the disk of the Be star is small. In addition, the location of FRB 180916B in
the host galaxy is consistent with a BeXRB system.

We report on a systematic search for hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission in
coincidence with fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed by the AGILE satellite. We
used 13 years of AGILE archival data searching for time coincidences between
exposed FRBs and events detectable by the MCAL (0.4-100 MeV) and GRID (50
MeV-30 GeV) detectors at timescales ranging from milliseconds to days/weeks.
The current AGILE sky coverage allowed us to extend the search for high-energy
emission preceding and following the FRB occurrence. We considered all FRBs
sources currently included in catalogues, and identified a sub-sample (15
events) for which a good AGILE exposure either with MCAL or GRID was obtained.
In this paper we focus on non-repeating FRBs, compared to a few nearby
repeating sources. We did not detect significant MeV or GeV emission from any
event. Our hard X-ray upper limits (ULs) in the MeV energy range were obtained
for timescales from sub-millisecond to seconds, and in the GeV range from
minutes to weeks around event times. We focus on a sub-set of 5 non-repeating
and 2 repeating FRB sources whose distances are most likely smaller than that
of 180916.J0158+65 (150 Mpc). For these sources, our MeV ULs translate into ULs
on the isotropically-emitted energy of about 3x10^46 erg, comparable to that
observed in the 2004 giant flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1806-20. On
average, these nearby FRBs emit radio pulses of energies significantly larger
than the recently detected SGR 1935+2154 and are not yet associated with
intense MeV flaring.

Galaxies and groups of galaxies exist in dark-matter halos filled with
diffuse gas. The diffuse gas represents up to 80\% of the mass in luminous
matter within the halos (1,2), and is difficult to detect because of its low
density (particle number densities of $\lesssim10^{-4}$\,cm$^{-3}$) and high
temperature (mostly greater than $10^{6}$\,K). The spatial distribution and
total mass of this material determines, and is influenced by, the evolution of
galaxies and galaxy groups (3-5). Existing observational constraints on these
quantities are limited by sensitivity, and the necessity to accurately model
the ionization fraction, metal content, and pressure of the gas (6-8). Here we
report the detection of diffuse gas associated with nearby galaxies using the
dispersion measures (DMs) of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs). FRB DMs
provide direct measurements of the total ionized-gas contents along their
sightlines. Out of a sample of 474 distant FRBs from the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1
(9), we identify a sample of 24 events that likely intersect the dark-matter
halos of galaxies in the local Universe ($<40$\,Mpc). This subset of FRBs has
an excess mean DM of $200\pm100$\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$ over those that do not
intersect nearby galaxies. The excess is larger than expected for the diffuse
gas surrounding isolated galaxies, but may be explained by additional
contributions from gas surrounding galaxy groups, including from the Local
Group. This result demonstrates the predicted ability of FRBs to be used as
sensitive, model-independent measures of the diffuse-gas contents of
dark-matter halos (10-13).

Strange stars (SSs) are compact objects made of deconfined quarks. It is hard
to distinguish SSs from neutron stars as a thin crust composed of normal
hadronic matter may exist and obscure the whole surface of the SS. Here we
suggest that the intriguing repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by
the intermittent fractional collapses of the crust of an SS induced by
refilling of accretion materials from its low-mass companion. The
periodic/sporadic/clustered temporal behaviors of FRBs could be well understood
in our scenario. Especially, the periodicity is attributed to the modulation of
accretion rate through the disk instabilities. To account for a $\sim 16$-day
periodicity of the repeating FRB source 180916.J0158+65, a Shakura-Sunyaev disk
with a viscosity parameter of $\alpha \simeq 0.004$ and an accretion rate of
$\simeq 3 \times 10^{16}$~g~s$^{-1}$ in the low state is invoked. Our scenario,
if favored by future observations, will serve as indirect evidence for the
strange quark matter hypothesis.

The discovery of fast radio burst (FRB) 200428 from galactic SGR J1935+2154
makes it possible to measure rotational changes accompanied by FRBs and to test
several FRB models which may be simultaneously associated with glitches.
Inspired by this idea, we present order of magnitude calculations to the
scenarios proposed. FRB models such as global starquakes, crust fractures and
collisions between pulsars and asteroids/comets are discussed. For each
mechanism, the maximum glitch sizes are constrained by the isotropic energy
release during the X-ray burst and/or the SGR J1935+2154-like radio burst rate.
Brief calculations show that, the maximum glitch sizes for different mechanisms
differ by order(s) of magnitude. If glitches are detected to be coincident with
FRBs from galactic magnetars in the future, glitch behaviors (such as glitch
size, rise timescale, the recovery coefficient and spin down rate offset) are
promising to serve as criterions to distinguish glitch mechanisms and in turn
to constrain FRB models.

'Downwards drifting' structures observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs) could
naturally arise from a screen occurring after a small initial dispersion
measure region. The screen imprints temporally sharp but broadband structure on
the pulse that has already been dispersed, and the `structure-maximising' bulk
of the dispersion measure is acquired further along the path to observer. If
so, scaling of the drift rate of repeating FRBs with frequency suggests that
the emission is beamed -- out of our line of sight -- with the circum-burst
plasma deflecting the beam towards us. This in turn explains the observed
limited, variable bandwidths of bursts despite broadband nature of the
underlying emission. We summarise the geometric constraints on this simple
model delivering much of the observed FRB spectro-temporal phenomenology,
present generic predictions and discuss possible nature of modulation.

Magnetic flares create hot relativistic shocks outside the light cylinder
radius of a magnetised star. Radio emission produced in such a shock or at a
radius smaller than the shock undergoes free-free absorption while passing
through the shocked medium. In this work, we demonstrate that this free-free
absorption can lead to a negative drift in the frequency-time spectra. Whether
it is related to the downward drift pattern observed in fast radio bursts
(FRBs) is unclear. However, if the FRB down drifting is due to this mechanism
then it will be pronounced in those shocks that have isotropic kinetic energies
$\gtrsim10^{44}$ erg. In this model, for an internal shock with a Lorentz
factor $\sim100$, the normalised drift rate $|{\rm DR_{\rm obs}}|/\nu_{\rm
mean}$ is $\sim10^{-2}$ per ms, where $\nu_{\rm mean}$ is the central frequency
of the radio pulses. The corresponding radius of the shocked shell is,
therefore, in the range of $10^{10}$ cm and $10^{11}$ cm. This implies that,
for an outflow consisting of hydrogen ion, the upper limit on the mass of the
relativistic shocks is a few $\times~10^{-10}~M_\odot$, which is considerably
low compared to that ejected from SGR 1806-20 during the 2004 outburst.

The repeating FRBs 180916.J0158 and 121102 are visible during
periodically-occuring windows in time. We consider the constraints on internal
magnetic fields and geometry if the cyclical behavior observed for
FRB~180916.J0158 and FRB 121102 is due to precession of magnetars. In order to
frustrate vortex line pinning we argue that internal magnetic fields must be
stronger than about $10^{16}$ Gauss, which is large enough to prevent
superconductivity in the core and destroy the crustal lattice structure. We
conjecture that the magnetic field inside precessing magnetars has three
components, (1) a dipole component with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{14}$
Gauss; (2) a toroidal component with characteristic strength $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16}$ Gauss which only occupies a modest fraction of the stellar
volume; and (3) a disordered field with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{16}$
Gauss. The disordered field is primarily responsible for permitting precession,
which stops once this field component decays away, which we conjecture happens
after $\sim 1000$ years. Conceivably, as the disordered component damps
bursting activity diminishes and eventually ceases. We model the quadrupolar
magnetic distortion of the star, which is due to its ordered components
primarily, as triaxial and very likely prolate. We address the question of
whether or not the spin frequency ought to be detectable for precessing,
bursting magnetars by constructing a specific model in which bursts happen
randomly in time with random directions distributed in or between cones
relative to a single symmetry axis. Within the context of these specific
models, we find that there are precession geometries for which detecting the
spin frequency is very unlikely.

Two repeating FRB sources, FRB180916 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, 2020a) and
FRB121102 (Rajwade, et al., 2020, Cruces, et al., 2021) display periodic
windowed behavior (PWB) in the times of FRB detections. In PWB, events only
occur within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the period, but no
events may occur during many of the periods. During UT 2020 April 28, two peaks
of a soft gamma burst (Li, et al., 2021) were identified with two FRB peaks
(CHIME/FRB Collaboration, et al., 2020b) from soft gamma repeater (SGR)
1935+2154. As SGRs are a type of magnetar, these observations establish a link
between at least some FRBs and magnetars. The analysis herein, which selects
the period giving the minimum window fraction, shows PWB in this source's soft
gamma-ray emission. For 161 bursts from 2014 through 2020 from IPN
(Interplanetary Network) instruments, a clearly resolved minimum in window
fraction vs. period occurs at a 231 +/- 9 day period, and 55 \% window
fraction. The data cover only 6 bursting episodes, however, the periodicity
result appears relatively robust: First, the IPN has excellent time coverage
and is unlikely to miss bursts outside of these windows. Second, for various
data subsets (with significantly less bursts), either the best or second best
measured period was consistent with 231 days, even in the sub-sample with the
richest bursting episode removed. In addition, simulations show that even small
numbers of uniform random bursts do not show PWB, and that the results are not
due to limited sampling. The apparent PWB could have alternative explanations;
a firm conclusion of PWB would be evident, however, after the observation of
more consistent episodes. If the periodicity of this SGR's bursts can be
verified, and if similar behavior were observed in other repeating FRB sources,
it might suggest a linkage between FRB and SGR burst mechanisms or emission
conditions.

Turbulence is a vital part of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies,
contributing significantly to galaxy energy budgets and acting as a regulator
of star formation. Despite this, little is understood about ISM turbulence
empirically. In the Milky Way, multiple tracers are used to reconstruct the
density- and velocity-fluctuation power spectra over an enormous range of
scales, but questions remain on the nature of these fluctuations at the
smallest scales. Even less is known about the ISM of distant galaxies, where
only a few tracers of turbulence, such as non-thermal broadening of optical
recombination lines, are accessible. We explore the use of radio-wave
scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to add a second probe of turbulence in
extragalactic galaxies on scales many orders of magnitude smaller than those
probed by emission-line widths. We first develop the formalism to compare the
scattering measures of FRBs to alternative probes of density and velocity
fluctuations in the host-galaxy ISM. We then apply this formalism to three FRBs
with detailed host-galaxy analyses in the literature, with the primary
motivation of determining whether FRB scattering within the host galaxy probes
the same turbulent cascade as the gas seen in H${\rm \alpha}$ emission. In all
cases we consider, we find such an association plausible, although in one of
these sources, FRB 20121102A, the radio-scattering limit on the turbulent
energy is much less constraining than the H${\rm \alpha}$ line width. We
anticipate that future FRB surveys, especially those at frequencies below 1
GHz, will find many FRBs that illuminate the small-scale properties of
extragalactic ISM.

The fast radio bursts ( FRBs ) are energetic radio bursts with millisecond
duration only observed at radio frequencies. The generation mechanism is still
mysterious. We have proposed a generation mechanism of both repeating and
one-off FRBs. They arise from the axion star collision with neutron star or
magnetized accretion disk of galactic black hole. Once we accept the existence
of the axions, we find that the mechanism well explain previously observed
spectral-temporal features. In this paper we show that it also explains
recently observed phenomena such as downward drifting in the repeating FRBs,
etc.. Analysis of the downward drifting based on Doppler effects has been
presented in recent papers, in which a superradiance system of molecular or
atom has been proposed as a source of FRBs. We apply the analysis to our
mechanism and find that it well explains the relation between the downward
drifting rate and the duration of the repeating FRBs. The Doppler effects lead
to the fact that the duration of radio burst with higher center frequency is
shorter than that of radio burst with lower center frequency in the repeating
FRBs. Our generation mechanism naturally explain polarization angle swing
observed in the repeating FRB180301 and one-off FRBs. We also discuss the
association between the FRB200428 and magnetar SGR J1935+2154. The X ray burst
observed just after the observation of the FRB could be triggered by the axion
star collision with the magnetar. We also explain the consistency of our
generation mechanism with observed spectral-temporal differences in the
repeating and one-off FRBs, e.g. longer duration ( smaller flux density ) of
repeating FRBs than duration ( flux density ) of one-off FRBs.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic pulses of millisecond
duration and unknown origin. In order to understand the phenomenon that emits
these pulses, targeted and untargeted searches have been performed for
multi-wavelength counterparts, including the optical. The objective of this
work is to search for optical transients at the position of 8 well-localized
FRBs, after the arrival of the burst on different time-scales (typically at one
day, several months, and one year after FRB detection) in order to compare with
known transient optical light curves. We used the Las Cumbres Observatory
Global Telescope Network (LCOGT), which allows us to promptly take images owing
to its network of twenty-three telescopes working around the world. We used a
template subtraction technique on all the images we collected at different
epochs. We have divided the subtractions into two groups, in one group we use
the image of the last epoch as a template and in the other group we use the
image of the first epoch as a template. We have searched for bright optical
transients at the localizations of the FRBs (<1 arcsec) in the template
subtracted images. We have found no optical transients, so we have set limiting
magnitudes of optical counterparts. Typical limiting magnitudes in apparent
(absolute) magnitudes for our LCOGT data are ~22 (-19) mag in the r-band. We
have compared our limiting magnitudes with light curves of superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe), type Ia supernovae (SNe), supernovae associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRB SNe), a kilonova, and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We
rule out that FRBs are associated with SLSN at a confidence of ~99.9%. We can
also rule out the brightest sub-types of type Ia SNe, GRB SNe and TDEs (under
some conditions) at similar confidence, though we cannot exclude scenarios
where FRBs are associated with the faintest sub-type of each of these transient
classes.

We study the spectro-temporal characteristics of two repeating fast radio
bursts (FRBs), namely, FRB 20180916B and FRB 20180814A, and combine the results
with those from our earlier analysis on FRB 20121102A. The relationship between
the frequency drift rate, or slope, of individual sub-bursts and their temporal
duration is investigated. We consider a broad sample of possible dispersion
measure (DM) values for each source to understand the range of valid sub-burst
slope and duration measurements for all bursts and to constrain our results. We
find good agreement with an inverse scaling law between the two parameters
previously predicted using a simple dynamical relativistic model. The
remarkably similar behaviour observed in all sources provides strong evidence
that a single and common underlying physical phenomenon is responsible for the
emission of signals from these three FRBs, despite their associations with
different types of host galaxies at various redshifts. It also opens up the
possibility that this sub-burst slope law may be a universal property among
repeating FRBs, or indicates a distinct subclass among them.

The mergers of two neutron stars are typically accompanied by broad-band
electromagnetic emission from either a relativistic jet or a kilonova. It has
also been long predicted that coherent radio emission will occur during the
merger phase or from a newly formed neutron star remnant, however this emission
has not been seen to date. This paper presents the deepest limits for this
emission from a neutron star merger folowing triggered LOFAR observations of
the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) 181123B, starting 4.4 minutes after the GRB
occurred. During the X-ray plateau phase, a signature of ongoing energy
injection, we detect no radio emission to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 153 mJy at 144
MHz (image integration time of 136 seconds), which is significantly fainter
than the predicted emission from a standard neutron star. At a redshift of 1.8,
this corresponds to a luminosity of $2.5 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Snapshot
images were made of the radio observation on a range of timescales, targeting
short duration radio flashes similar to fast radio bursts (FRBs). No emission
was detected in the snapshot images at the location of GRB 181123B enabling
constraints to be placed on the prompt coherent radio emission model and
emission predicted to occur when a neutron star collapses to form a black hole.
At the putative host redshift of 1.8 for GRB 181123B, the non detection of the
prompt radio emission is two orders of magnitude lower than expected for
magnetic reconnection models for prompt GRB emission and no magnetar emission
is expected.

The recent increase in well-localised fast radio bursts (FRBs) has
facilitated in-depth studies of global FRB host properties, the source
circumburst medium, and the potential impacts of these environments on the
burst properties. The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) has
localised 11 FRBs with sub-arcsecond to arcsecond precision, leading to
sub-galaxy localisation regions in some cases and those covering much of the
host galaxy in others. The method used to astrometrically register the FRB
image frame for ASKAP, in order to align it with images taken at other
wavelengths, is currently limited by the brightness of continuum sources
detected in the short-duration ('snapshot') voltage data captured by the
Commensal Real-Time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) software correlator, which
are used to correct for any frame offsets due to imperfect calibration
solutions and estimate the accuracy of any required correction. In this paper,
we use dedicated observations of bright, compact radio sources in ASKAP's low-
and mid-frequency bands to investigate the typical astrometric accuracy of the
positions obtained using this so-called 'snapshot' technique. Having captured
these data with both the CRAFT software and ASKAP hardware correlators, we also
compare the offset distributions obtained from both data products to estimate a
typical offset between the image frames resulting from the differing processing
paths, laying the groundwork for future use of the longer-duration, higher
signal-to-noise ratio data recorded by the hardware correlator. We find typical
offsets between the two frames of $\sim 0.6$ and $\sim 0.3$ arcsec in the low-
and mid-band data, respectively, for both RA and Dec. We also find reasonable
agreement between our offset distributions and those of the published FRBs.

The recent discovery of a Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) occurring
simultaneously with an X-ray burst (XRB) from the Galactic magnetar SGR
J1935+2154 implies that at least some FRBs arise from magnetar activities. We
propose that FRBs are triggered by crust fracturing of magnetars, with the
burst event rate depending on the magnetic field strength in the crust. Since
the crust fracturing rate is relatively higher in polar regions, FRBs are
preferred to be triggered near the directions of multipolar magnetic poles.
Crust fracturing produces Alfv\'en waves, forming a charge starved region in
the magnetosphere and leading to non-stationary pair plasma discharges. An FRB
is produced by coherent plasma radiation due to nonuniform pair production
across magnetic field lines. Meanwhile, the FRB-associated XRB is produced by
the rapid relaxation of the external magnetic field lines. In this picture, the
sharp-peak hard X-ray component in association with FRB 200428 is from a region
between adjacent trapped fireballs, and its spectrum with a high cutoff energy
is attributed to resonant Compton scattering. The persistent X-ray emission is
from a hot spot heated by the magnetospheric activities, and its temperature
evolution is dominated by magnetar surface cooling. Within this picture,
magnetars with stronger fields tend to produce brighter and more frequent
repeated bursts.

Flares of known astronomical sources and new transient phenomena occur on
different timescales, from sub-seconds to several days or weeks. The discovery
potential of both serendipitous observations and multi-messenger and
multi-wavelength follow-up observations could be maximized with a tool which
allows for quickly acquiring an overview over both persistent sources as well
as transient events in the relevant phase space. We here present COincidence
LIBrary for Real-time Inquiry (Astro-COLIBRI), a novel and comprehensive tool
for this task.
  Astro-COLIBRI's architecture comprises a RESTful API, a real-time database, a
cloud-based alert system and a website (https://astro-colibri.com) as well as
apps for iOS and Android as clients for users. The structure of Astro-COLIBRI
is optimized for performance and reliability and exploits concepts such as
multi-index database queries, a global content delivery network (CDN), and
direct data streams from the database to the clients. Astro-COLIBRI evaluates
incoming VOEvent messages of astronomical observations in real time, filters
them by user-specified criteria and puts them into their MWL and MM context.
The clients provide a graphical representation with an easy to grasp summary of
the relevant data to allow for the fast identification of interesting phenomena
and provides an assessment of observing conditions at a large selection of
observatories around the world.
  We here summarize the key features of Astro-COLIBRI, the architecture and
used data resources. We specifically provide examples for applications and use
cases. Focussing on the high-energy domain, we showcase how Astro-COLIBRI
facilitates the search for high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to high-energy
neutrinos and scheduling of follow-up observations of a large variety of
transient phenomena like gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves, TDEs, FRBs, and
others.

Polarimetric observations of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a powerful resource
for better understanding these mysterious sources by directly probing the
emission mechanism of the source and the magneto-ionic properties of its
environment. We present a pipeline for analysing the polarized signal of FRBs
captured by the triggered baseband recording system operating on the FRB survey
of The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME/FRB). Using a
combination of simulated and real FRB events, we summarize the main features of
the pipeline and highlight the dominant systematics affecting the polarized
signal. We compare parametric (QU-fitting) and non-parametric (rotation measure
synthesis) methods for determining the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and find
the latter method susceptible to systematic errors from known instrumental
effects of CHIME/FRB observations. These errors include a leakage artefact that
appears as polarized signal near $\rm{RM\sim 0 \; rad \, m^{-2}}$ and an RM
sign ambiguity introduced by path length differences in the system's
electronics. We apply the pipeline to a bright burst previously reported by
\citet[FRB 20191219F;][]{Leung2021}, detecting an $\mathrm{RM}$ of $\rm{+6.074
\pm 0.006 \pm 0.050 \; rad \, m^{-2}}$ with a significant linear polarized
fraction ($\gtrsim0.87$) and strong evidence for a non-negligible circularly
polarized component. Finally, we introduce an RM search method that employs a
phase-coherent de-rotation algorithm to correct for intra-channel
depolarization in data that retain electric field phase information, and
successfully apply it to an unpublished FRB, FRB 20200917A, measuring an
$\mathrm{RM}$ of $\rm{-1294.47 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.05 \; rad \, m^{-2}}$ (the second

Relativistic magnetized shocks are a natural source of coherent emission,
offering a plausible radiative mechanism for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We
present first-principles 3D simulations that provide essential information for
the FRB models based on shocks: the emission efficiency, spectrum, and
polarization. The simulated shock propagates in an $e^\pm$ plasma with
magnetization $\sigma>1$. The measured fraction of shock energy converted to
coherent radiation is $\simeq 10^{-3} \, \sigma^{-1}$, and the energy-carrying
wavenumber of the wave spectrum is $\simeq 4 \,\omega_{\rm c}/c$, where
$\omega_{\rm c}$ is the upstream gyrofrequency. The ratio of the O-mode and
X-mode energy fluxes emitted by the shock is $\simeq 0.4\,\sigma^{-1}$. The
dominance of the X-mode at $\sigma\gg 1$ is particularly strong, approaching
100% in the spectral band around $2\,\omega_{\rm c}$. We also provide a
detailed description of the emission mechanism for both X- and O-modes.

The discovery of periodicity in the arrival times of the fast radio bursts
(FRBs) poses a challenge to the oft-studied magnetar scenarios. However, models
that postulate that FRBs result from magnetized shocks or magnetic reconnection
in a relativistic outflow are not specific to magnetar engines; instead, they
require only the impulsive injection of relativistic energy into a dense
magnetized medium. Motivated thus, we outline a new scenario in which FRBs are
powered by short-lived relativistic outflows (``flares'') from accreting black
holes or neutron stars, which propagate into the cavity of the pre-existing
(``quiescent'') jet. In order to reproduce FRB luminosities and rates, we are
driven to consider binaries of stellar-mass compact objects undergoing
super-Eddington mass-transfer, similar to ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources.
Indeed, the host galaxies of FRBs, and their spatial offsets within their
hosts, show broad similarities with ULXs. Periodicity on timescales of days to
years could be attributed to precession (e.g., Lens-Thirring) of the polar
accretion funnel, along which the FRB emission is geometrically and
relativistically beamed, which sweeps across the observer line of sight.
Accounting for the most luminous FRBs via accretion power may require a
population of binaries undergoing brief-lived phases of unstable
(dynamical-timescale) mass-transfer. This will lead to secular evolution in the
properties of some repeating FRBs on timescales of months to years, followed by
a transient optical/IR counterpart akin to a luminous red nova, or a more
luminous accretion-powered optical/X-ray transient. We encourage targeted FRB
searches of known ULX sources.

Galactic electron density distribution models are crucial tools for
estimating the impact of the ionised interstellar medium on the impulsive
signals from radio pulsars and fast radio bursts. The two prevailing Galactic
electron density models are YMW16 (Yao et al., 2017) and NE2001 (Cordes &
Lazio, 2002). Here, we introduce a software package PyGEDM which provides a
unified application programming interface (API) for these models and the YT20
(Yamasaki & Totani, 2020) model of the Galactic halo. We use PyGEDM to compute
all-sky maps of Galactic dispersion measure (DM) for YMW16 and NE2001, and
compare the large-scale differences between the two. In general, YMW16 predicts
higher DM values toward the Galactic anticentre. YMW16 predicts higher DMs at
low Galactic latitudes, but NE2001 predicts higher DMs in most other
directions. We identify lines of sight for which the models are most
discrepant, using pulsars with independent distance measurements. YMW16
performs better on average than NE2001, but both models show significant
outliers. We suggest that future campaigns to determine pulsar distances should
focus on targets where the models show large discrepancies, so future models
can use those measurements to better estimate distances along those line of
sight. We also suggest that the Galactic halo should be considered as a
component in future GEDMs, to avoid overestimating the Galactic DM contribution
for extragalactic sources such as FRBs.

We investigate whether the sky rate of Fast Radio Bursts depends on Galactic
latitude using the first catalog of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) detected by the
Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB)
Project. We first select CHIME/FRB events above a specified sensitivity
threshold in consideration of the radiometer equation, and then compare these
detections with the expected cumulative time-weighted exposure using
Anderson-Darling and Kolmogrov-Smirnov tests. These tests are consistent with
the null hypothesis that FRBs are distributed without Galactic latitude
dependence ($p$-values distributed from 0.05 to 0.99, depending on completeness
threshold). Additionally, we compare rates in intermediate latitudes ($|b| <
15^\circ$) with high latitudes using a Bayesian framework, treating the
question as a biased coin-flipping experiment -- again for a range of
completeness thresholds. In these tests the isotropic model is significantly
favored (Bayes factors ranging from 3.3 to 14.2). Our results are consistent
with FRBs originating from an isotropic population of extragalactic sources.

Nine point sources appeared within half an hour on a region within $\sim$ 10
arcmin of a red-sensitive photographic plate taken in April 1950 as part of the
historic Palomar Sky Survey. All nine sources are absent on both previous and
later photographic images, and absent in modern surveys with CCD detectors
which go several magnitudes deeper. We present deep CCD images with the
10.4-meter Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), reaching brightness $r \sim 26$ mag,
that reveal possible optical counterparts, although these counterparts could
equally well be just chance projections. The incidence of transients in the
investigated photographic plate is far higher than expected from known
detection rates of optical counterparts to e.g.\ flaring dwarf stars, Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) or microlensing events. One
possible explanation is that the plates have been subjected to an unknown type
of contamination producing mainly point sources with of varying intensities
along with some mechanism of concentration within a radius of $\sim$ 10 arcmin
on the plate. If contamination as an explanation can be fully excluded, another
possibility is fast (t $<0.5$ s) solar reflections from objects near
geosynchronous orbits. An alternative route to confirm the latter scenario is
by looking for images from the First Palomar Sky Survey where multiple
transients follow a line.

The physical properties of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies provide
important clues towards the nature of FRB sources. The 16 FRB hosts identified
thus far span three orders of magnitude in mass and specific star-formation
rate, implicating a ubiquitously occurring progenitor object. FRBs localised
with ~arcsecond accuracy also enable effective searches for associated
multi-wavelength and multi-timescale counterparts, such as the persistent radio
source associated with FRB 20121102A. Here we present a localisation of the
repeating source FRB 20201124A, and its association with a host galaxy (SDSS
J050803.48+260338.0, z=0.098) and persistent radio source. The galaxy is
massive ($\sim3\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$), star-forming (few solar masses per
year), and dusty. Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array observations of
the persistent radio source measure a luminosity of $1.2\times10^{29}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, and show that is extended on scales $\gtrsim50$ mas. We
associate this radio emission with the ongoing star-formation activity in SDSS
J050803.48+260338.0. Deeper, more detailed observations are required to better
utilise the milliarcsecond-scale localisation of FRB 20201124A reported from
the European VLBI Network, and determine the origin of the large dispersion
measure ($150-220$ pc cm$^{-3}$) contributed by the host. SDSS
J050803.48+260338.0 is an order of magnitude more massive than any galaxy or
stellar system previously associated with a repeating FRB source, but is
comparable to the hosts of so far non-repeating FRBs, further building the link
between the two apparent populations.

The main FRB event may leave behind a clump of relativistic plasma with high
``free energy'' density. As the plasma undergoes collisionless relaxation, it
emits coherent electromagnetic waves. These electromagnetic waves may be
observable as a fast radio afterglow, with decreasing frequency and intensity.
We demonstrate the fast coherent afterglow in a numerical experiment. We
tentatively predict the peak afterglow frequency decreasing with time as $\nu
\propto t^{-3/2}$.

Magnetars have been proposed to be the origin of FRBs soon after its initial
discovery. The detection of the first Galactic FRB 20200428 from SGR 1935+2154
has made this hypothesis more convincing. In October 2020, this source was
supposed to be in an extremely active state again. We then carried out a
1.6-hours follow-up observation of SGR 1935+2154 using the new ultra-wideband
low (UWL) receiver of the Parkes 64\,m radio telescope covering a frequency
range of 704$-$4032 MHz. However, no convincing signal was detected in either
of our single pulse or periodicity searches. We obtained a limit on the flux
density of periodic signal of $\rm 3.6\,\mu Jy$ using the full 3.3GHz bandwidth
data sets, which is the strictest limit for that of SGR 1935+2154. Our full
bandwidth limit on the single pulses fluence is 35mJy ms, which is well below
the brightest single pulses detected by the FAST radio telescope just two
before our observation. Assuming that SGR 1935+2154 is active during our
observation, our results suggest that its radio bursts are either intrinsically
narrowband or show a steep spectrum.

We present a synthesis of fast radio burst (FRB) morphology (the change in
flux as a function of time and frequency) as detected in the 400-800 MHz octave
by the FRB project on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment
(CHIME/FRB), using events from the first CHIME/FRB catalog. The catalog
consists of 61 bursts from 18 repeating sources, plus 474 one-off FRBs,
detected between 2018 July 25 and 2019 July 2. We identify four observed
archetypes of burst morphology ("simple broadband," "simple narrowband,"
"temporally complex" and "downward drifting") and describe relevant
instrumental biases that are essential for interpreting the observed
morphologies. Using the catalog properties of the FRBs, we confirm that bursts
from repeating sources, on average, have larger widths and we show, for the
first time, that bursts from repeating sources, on average, are narrower in
bandwidth. This difference could be due to a beaming or propagation effects, or
it could be intrinsic to the populations. We discuss potential implications of
these morphological differences for using FRBs as astrophysical tools.

The first repeating fast radio burst source, FRB 121102, is observed to emit
bursts periodically. We show that FRB 121102 can be interpreted as an
interacting neutron star binary system with an orbital period of 159 days. We
develop a binary comb model by introducing an eccentricity in the orbit.
Besides the original funnel mode of the binary comb model, which was applied to
FRB 180916.J0158+65 by Ioka and Zhang 2020, we also identify two new modes of
the binary comb model, i.e. the tau-crossing mode and the inverse funnel mode,
and apply them to interpret FRB 121102. These new developments expand the
applicable parameter space, allowing the companion star to be a massive star, a
massive black hole, or a supermassive black hole, with the latter two having
larger parameter spaces. These models are also consistent with other
observations, such as the persistent bright radio counterpart associated with
the source. We also argue that the observed frequency dependence of the active
window does not disfavor the binary comb model, in contrast to recent claims,
and propose two possible scenarios to interpret the data.

Context. The increased detection rate of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) makes it
likely to get samples of sizes $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ in
the near future. Because of their extragalactic origin can help us in
understanding the epoch of helium reionization.
  Aims. We try to identify the epoch of Helium II (HeII) reionization, via the
observations of early FRBs in range of $z=3$ to $4$.
  Methods. We build a model of FRB Dispersion Measure following the HeII
reionization model, density fluctuation in large scale structure, host galaxy
interstellar medium and local environment of FRB contribution. The model is fit
to the ideal intergalactic medium (IGM) dispersion measure model to check the
goodness of constraining the HeII reionization via FRB measurement statistics.
  Conclusion. We report our findings under two categories, accuracy in
detection of HeII reionization via FRBs assuming no uncertainty in the redshift
measurement and alternatively assuming a varied level of uncertainty in
redshift measurement of the FRBs. We show that under the first case, a
detection of $N\sim\mathcal{O} (10^2)$ FRBs give an uncertainty of $\sigma
(z_{r, fit})\sim0.5$ from the fit model, and a detection of $N\sim\mathcal{O}
(10^3)$ gives an uncertainty of $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.1$. While assuming a
redshift uncertainty of level $5-20\%$, changes the $\sigma (z_{r,
fit})\sim0.5$ to $0.6$ for $N\sim 100$ and $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.1$ to
$0.15$ for $N \sim 1000$ case.

We present a detailed study of the complex time-frequency structure of a
sample of previously reported bursts of FRB 121102 detected with the MeerKAT
telescope in September 2019. The wide contiguous bandwidth of these
observations have revealed a complex bifurcating structure in some bursts at
$1250$ MHz. When de-dispersed to their structure-optimised dispersion measures,
two of the bursts show a clear deviation from the cold plasma dispersion
relationship below $1250$ MHz. We find a differential dispersion measure of
${\sim}1{-}2$ pc cm$^{-3}$ between the lower and higher frequency regions of
each burst. We investigate the possibility of plasma lensing by Gaussian lenses
of ${\sim}10$ AU in the host galaxy, and demonstrate that they can
qualitatively produce some of the observed burst morphologies. Other possible
causes for the observed frequency dependence, such as Faraday delay, are also
discussed. Unresolved sub-components in the bursts, however, may have led to an
incorrect DM determination. We hence advise exercising caution when considering
bursts in isolation. We analyse the presence of two apparent burst pairs. One
of these pairs is a potential example of upward frequency drift. The
possibility that burst pairs are echoes is also discussed. The average
structure-optimised dispersion measure is found to be $563.5\pm 0.2
(\text{sys}) \pm 0.8 (\text{stat})$ pc cm$^{-3}$ $-$ consistent with the values
reported in 2018. We use two independent methods to determine the
structure-optimised dispersion measure of the bursts: the DM_phase algorithm
and autocorrelation functions. The latter $-$ originally developed for pulsar
analysis $-$ is applied to FRBs for the first time in this paper.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients with millisecond
durations. Recently, a periodic activity of $\sim$16 day and a possible
periodicity of $\sim$159 day were detected to arise from FRB 180916.J0158+65
and FRB 121102, respectively, and the spin period of a slow-rotation magnetar
was further considered to be one of possibilities to explain the periodic
activities of repeating FRBs. For isolated neutron stars, the spin evolution
suggests that it's difficult to reach several hours. In this work, we mainly
focus on the possible maximum spin period of isolated NSs / magnetars dominated
by an interaction between star's magnetic field and the disk. We find that the
disk wind plays an important role in spin evolution, whose influence varies the
power law index in the evolution equation of mass flow rate. For a magnetar
without disk wind, the longest spin period is tens of hours. When the disk wind
with a classical parameter is involved, the maximum spin period can reach
hundreds of hours. But for a much extremely large index of mass flow rate due
to disk wind or other angular momentum extraction processes, a spin period of
$\sim$(16-160) days is still possible.

We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST/WFC3) ultraviolet and infrared
observations of eight fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies with sub-arcsecond
localizations, including the hosts of three known repeating FRBs. We quantify
their spatial distributions and locations with respect to their host galaxy
light distributions, finding that they occur at moderate host
normalized-offsets of 1.4 $r_e$ ([0.6,2.1] $r_e$; 68% interval), occur on
fainter regions of their hosts in terms of IR light, but overall trace the
radial distribution of IR light in their galaxies. The FRBs in our tested
distribution do not clearly trace the distributions of any other transient
population with known progenitors, and are statistically distinct from the
locations of LGRBs, H-poor SLSNe, SGRBs, and Ca-rich transients. We further
find that most FRBs are not in regions of elevated local star formation rate
and stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of
their hosts. We also place upper limits to the IR flux at the FRB positions of
$m_{\rm IR}\gtrsim\!24.8-27.6$~AB~mag, constraining both satellite and
background galaxies to luminosities well below the host luminosity of
FRB121102. We find that 5/8 FRB hosts exhibit clear spiral arm features in IR
light, and that the positions of all well-localized FRBs located in such hosts
are consistent with their spiral arms, although not on their brightest regions.
Our results do not strongly support the primary progenitor channel of FRBs
being connected either with the most massive (stripped-envelope) stars, or with
events which require kicks and long delay times (neutron star mergers).

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic, short, bright transients that occur
frequently over the entire radio sky. The observational challenges following
from their fleeting, generally one-off nature have prevented identification of
the underlying sources producing the bursts. As the population of detected FRBs
grows, the observed distributions of brightness, pulse width and dispersion
measure now begin to take shape. Meaningful direct interpretation of these
distributions is, however, made impossible by the selection effects that
telescope and search pipelines invariably imprint on each FRB survey. Here we
show that multi-dimensional FRB population synthesis can find a single,
self-consistent population of FRB sources that can reproduce the real-life
results of the major ongoing FRB surveys. This means that individual observed
distributions can now be combined to derive the properties of the intrinsic FRB
source population. The characteristics of our best-fit model for one-off FRBs
agree with a population of magnetars. We extrapolate this model and predict the
number of FRBs future surveys will find. For surveys that have commenced, the
method we present here can already determine the composition of the FRB source
class, and potentially even its subpopulations.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events with durations on
the order of milliseconds. The majority of FRB sources discovered so far have a
single peak, with the exception of a few showing multiple-peaked profiles, the
origin of which is unknown. In this work, we show that the strong lensing
effect of a point mass or a point mass $+$ external shear on a single-peak FRB
can produce double peaks (i.e. lensed images). In particular, the leading peak
will always be more magnified and hence brighter than the trailing peak for a
point-mass lens model, while the point-mass $+$ external shear lens model can
produce a less magnified leading peak. We find that, for a point-mass lens
model, the combination of lens mass $M$ and redshift $z_l$ in the form of
$M(1+z_l)$ can be directly computed from two observables -- the delayed time
$\Delta t$ and the flux ratio of the leading peak to the trailing peak $R$. For
a point-mass $+$ external shear lens model, upper and lower limits in
$M(1+z_l)$ can also be obtained from $\Delta t$ and $R$ for a given external
shear strength. In particular, tighter lens mass constraints can be achieved
when the observed $R$ is larger. Lastly, we show the process of constraining
lens mass using the observed values of $\Delta t$ and $R$ of two double-peaked
FRB sources, i.e. FRB 121002 and FRB 130729, as references, although the
double-peaked profiles are not necessarily caused by strong lensing.

Nowadays, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been a promising probe for astronomy
and cosmology. However, it is not easy to identify the redshifts of FRBs to
date. Thus, no sufficient actual FRBs with identified redshifts can be used to
study cosmology currently. In the past years, one has to use the simulated FRBs
with "known" redshifts instead. To simulate an FRB, one should randomly assign
a redshift to it from a given redshift distribution. But the actual redshift
distribution of FRBs is still unknown so far. Therefore, many redshift
distributions have been assumed in the literature. In the present work, we
study the effect of various redshift distributions on cosmological constraints,
while they are treated equally. We find that different redshift distributions
lead to different cosmological constraining abilities from the simulated FRBs.
This result emphasizes the importance to find the actual redshift distribution
of FRBs, and reminds us of the possible bias in the FRB simulations due to the
redshift distributions.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely strong radio flares lasting several
milliseconds, most of which come from unidentified objects at a cosmological
distance. They can be apparently repeating or not. In this paper, we analyzed
18 repeaters and 12 non-repeating FRBs observed in the frequency bands of
400-800 MHz from CHIME. We investigated the distributions of FRB
isotropic-equivalent radio luminosity, considering the K correction.
Statistically, the luminosity distribution can be better fitted by Gaussian
form than by power-law. Based on the above results, together with the observed
FRB event rate, pulse duration, and radio luminosity, FRB origin models are
evaluated and constrained such that the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be excluded
for the non-repeaters while magnetars or neutron stars (NSs) emitting the
supergiant pulses are preferred for the repeaters. We also found the necessity
of a small FRB emission beaming solid angle (about 0.1 sr) from magnetars that
should be considered, and/or the FRB association with soft gamma-ray repeaters
(SGRs) may lie at a low probability of about 10%. Finally, we discussed the
uncertainty of FRB luminosity caused by the estimation of the distance that is
inferred by the simple relation between the redshift and dispersion measure
(DM).

In this paper, we study the evolution of the ionization fraction $x_e(z)$
during the epoch of reionization by using the dispersion measurements (DMs) of
fast radio bursts (FRBs). Different from the previous studies, here we turn to
consider the large-scale clustering information of observed DMs of FRB catalog,
which only needs the rough redshift distribution, instead of the exact redshift
information of each FRB. Firstly, we consider the instantaneous
``\texttt{tanh}'' model for $x_e(z)$ and find that including the
auto-correlation information of the mock catalog, about $10^4$ FRBs with the
intrinsic DM scatter of 100 $\rm pc/cm^3$ spanning 20\% of all sky, could
significantly improve the constraint on the width $\Delta_z$ of the model, when
comparing with that from the CMB data alone. The evolution shape of the
ionization fraction will be tightly narrowed, namely the duration of the epoch
of reionization has been shrunk, $z_{\rm dur}<2.24$ (95\% C.L.). Furthermore,
we also use another redshift-asymmetric reionization model and obtain that the
FRB mock catalog could measure the ionization fraction at $z=6$ precisely with
the $1\sigma$ error $\Delta x_e(z=6)=0.012$, which means that the large-scale
clustering information of observed DMs of FRB catalog is very sensitive to the
ionization fraction of the end of reionization epoch. We conclude that the
observation of high-redshift FRBs could be a complementary probe to study the
reionization history in the future.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the total column density of free electrons in
the intergalactic medium (IGM) along the path of propagation though the
dispersion measures (DMs) which depend on the baryon mass fraction in the IGM,
i.e., $f_{\rm IGM}$. In this letter, we investigate the large-scale clustering
information of DMs to study the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}$. When combining with
the Planck 2018 measurements, we could give tight constraints on the evolution
of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ from about $10^4$ FRBs with the intrinsic DM scatter of
$30(1+z)~ \rm pc/cm^3$ spanning 80% of the sky and redshift range $z=0-3$.
Firstly, we consider the Taylor expansion of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ up to second
order, and find that the mean relative standard deviation $\sigma(f_{\rm
IGM})\equiv\left\langle \sigma[f_{\rm IGM}(z)] /f_{\rm IGM}(z) \right\rangle$
is about 7.2%. In order to alleviate the dependence on fiducial model, we also
adopt a non-parametric methods in this work, the local principle component
analysis. We obtain the consistent, but weaker constraints on the evolution of
$f_{\rm IGM}(z)$, namely the mean relative standard deviation $\sigma(f_{\rm
IGM})$ is 24.2%. With the forthcoming surveys, this could be a complimentary
method to investigate the baryon mass fraction in the IGM.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are very short and bright transients visible over
extragalactic distances. The radio pulse undergoes dispersion caused by free
electrons along the line of sight, most of which are associated with the
large-scale structure (LSS). The total dispersion measure therefore increases
with the line of sight and provides a distance estimate to the source. We
present the first measurement of the Hubble constant using the dispersion
measure -- redshift relation of FRBs with identified host counterpart and
corresponding redshift information. A sample of nine currently available FRBs
yields a constraint of $H_0 = 62.3 \pm 9.1 \,\rm{km}
\,\rm{s}^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainty stemming from the
LSS, host halo and Milky Way contributions to the observed dispersion measure.
The main current limitation is statistical, and we estimate that a few hundred
events with corresponding redshifts are sufficient for a per cent measurement
of $H_0$. This is a number well within reach of ongoing FRB searches. We
perform a forecast using a realistic mock sample to demonstrate that a
high-precision measurement of the expansion rate is possible without relying on
other cosmological probes. FRBs can therefore arbitrate the current tension
between early and late time measurements of $H_0$ in the near future.

We report on the discovery of FRB 20200120E, a repeating fast radio burst
(FRB) with low dispersion measure (DM), detected by the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB project. The source DM of 87.82 pc
cm$^{-3}$ is the lowest recorded from an FRB to date, yet is significantly
higher than the maximum expected from the Milky Way interstellar medium in this
direction (~ 50 pc cm$^{-3}$). We have detected three bursts and one candidate
burst from the source over the period 2020 January-November. The baseband
voltage data for the event on 2020 January 20 enabled a sky localization of the
source to within $\simeq$ 14 sq. arcmin (90% confidence). The FRB localization
is close to M81, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The FRB appears on
the outskirts of M81 (projected offset $\sim$ 20 kpc) but well inside its
extended HI and thick disks. We empirically estimate the probability of chance
coincidence with M81 to be $< 10^{-2}$. However, we cannot reject a Milky Way
halo origin for the FRB. Within the FRB localization region, we find several
interesting cataloged M81 sources and a radio point source detected in the Very
Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). We searched for prompt X-ray counterparts in
Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM data, and for two of the FRB 20200120E bursts, we rule
out coincident SGR 1806$-$20-like X-ray bursts. Due to the proximity of FRB
20200120E, future follow-up for prompt multi-wavelength counterparts and
sub-arcsecond localization could be constraining of proposed FRB models.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short pulses observed in radio band from
cosmological distances. One class of models invoke soft gamma-ray repeaters
(SGRs), or magnetars, as the sources of FRBs. Some radio pulses have been
observed from some magnetars, however, no FRB-like events had been detected in
association any magnetar burst, including one giant flare. Recently, a pair of
FRB-like bursts (FRB 200428 hereafter) separated by milliseconds (ms) were
detected from the general direction of the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154.
Here we report the detection of a non-thermal X-ray burst in the 1-250 keV
energy band with the Insight-HXMT satellite, which we identify as emitted from
SGR J1935+2154. The burst showed two hard peaks with a separation of 34 ms,
broadly consistent with that of the two bursts in FRB 200428. The delay time
between the double radio and X-ray peaks is about 8.57 s, fully consistent with
the dispersion delay of FRB 200428. We thus identify the non-thermal X-ray
burst is associated with FRB 200428 whose high energy counterpart is the two
hard peaks in X-ray. Our results suggest that the non-thermal X-ray burst and
FRB 200428 share the same physical origin in an explosive event from SGR
J1935+2154.

The discovery and study of pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in
time-domain radio data is often hampered by radio frequency interference (RFI).
Some of this terrestrial RFI is impulsive and bright, and relatively easy to
identify and remove. Other anthropogenic signals, however, are weaker yet
periodic, and their persistence can drown out astrophysical signals. Here we
show that Fourier-domain excision of periodic RFI is an effective and powerful
step in detecting weak cosmic signals. We find that applying the method
significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio of transient as well as
periodic pulsar signals. In live studies, we detected single pulses from
pulsars and FRBs that would otherwise have remained buried in background noise.
We show the method has no negative effects on pulsar pulse shape and that it
enhances timing campaigns. We demonstrate the method on real-life data from a
number of large radio telescopes, and conclude that Fourier-domain RFI excision
increases the effective sensitivity to astrophysical sources by a significant
fraction which can be even larger than an order of magnitude in case of strong
RFI. An accelerated implementation of the method runs on standard time-domain
radio data formats and is publicly available.

The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown
despite more than a decade of efforts. Though several models have been proposed
to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of
events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB
sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154
seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge
all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a
single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only
come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as
possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of
optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting
point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search
campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we
summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in
view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be
identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more
dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale
transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the
identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of
the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks
to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes
co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap
complementary observational strategy.

We study parametric instability of compact axion dark matter structures
decaying to radiophotons. Corresponding objects - Bose (axion) stars, their
clusters, and clouds of diffuse axions - form abundantly in the
postinflationary Peccei-Quinn scenario. We develop general description of
parametric resonance incorporating finite-volume effects, backreaction, axion
velocities and their (in)coherence. With additional coarse-graining, our
formalism reproduces kinetic equation for virialized axions interacting with
photons. We derive conditions for the parametric instability in each of the
above objects, as well as in collapsing axion stars, evaluate photon resonance
modes and their growth exponents. As a by-product, we calculate stimulated
emission of Bose stars and diffuse axions, arguing that the former can give
larger contribution into the radiobackground. In the case of QCD axions, the
Bose stars glow and collapsing stars radioburst if the axion-photon coupling
exceeds the original KSVZ value by two orders of magnitude. The latter
constraint is alleviated for several nearby axion stars in resonance and absent
for axion-like particles. Our results show that the parametric effect may
reveal itself in observations, from FRB to excess radiobackground.

We show that old isolated neutron stars in groups and clusters of galaxies
experiencing a Quark-Nova phase (QN: an explosive transition to a quark star)
may be the source of FRBs. Each of the millions of fragments of the
ultra-relativistic QN ejecta provides a collisionless plasma for which the
ambient medium (galactic/halo, the intra-group/intra-cluster medium) acts as a
relativistic plasma beam. The Buneman and the Weibel instabilities,
successively induced by the beam in the fragment, generate particle bunching
and observed coherent emission at GHz frequency with a corresponding fluence in
the Jy ms range. The duration, frequency drift and the rate are in agreement
with observed properties of FRBs. Repeats (on timescales of minutes to months)
are due to seeing multiple fragments each beaming at a different direction and
coming in at different times. Single (non-repeating) FRBs, occur when only
emission from the primary fragment is within the detector's sensitivity. Key
properties of FRB 121102 (its years of activity) and of FRB 180916.J0158+65
(its 16 day period) are recovered. The spatial and temporal coincidence between
SGR 1935+2154 and FRB 200428 finds an explanation in our model. We give
testable predictions.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of correlated noise on fast radio
burst (FRB) searching. We found that 1) the correlated noise significantly
increases the false alarm probability; 2) the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of
the false positives become higher; 3) the correlated noise also affects the
pulse width distribution of false positives, and there will be more false
positives with wider pulse width. We use 55-hour observation for M82 galaxy
carried out at Nanshan 26m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of
the correlated noise modelling. The number of candidates and parameter
distribution of the false positives can be reproduced with the modelling of
correlated noise. We will also discuss a low S/N candidate detected in the
observation, for which we demonstrate the method to evaluate the false alarm
probability in the presence of correlated noise.Possible origins of the
candidate are discussed, where two possible pictures, an M82-harbored giant
pulse and a cosmological FRB, are both compatible with the observation.

We present the detection of an unresolved radio source coincident with the
position of the Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) PTF10hgi ($z=0.098$)
about 7.5 years post-explosion, with a flux density of $F_\nu(6\,\,{\rm
GHz)}\approx 47.3\ \mu Jy$ and a luminosity of $L_\nu(6\,\,{\rm GHz})\approx
1.1\times 10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. This represents the first detection
of radio emission coincident with a SLSN on any timescale. We investigate
various scenarios for the origin of the radio emission: star formation
activity, an active galactic nucleus, and a non-relativistic supernova
blastwave. While any of these would be quite novel if confirmed, none appear
likely when taken in context of the other properties of the host galaxy,
previous radio observations of SLSNe, and the general population of
hydrogen-poor SNe. Instead, the radio emission is reminiscent of the quiescent
radio source associated with the repeating FRB 121102, which has been argued to
be powered by a magnetar born in a SLSN or LGRB explosion several decades ago.
We show that the properties of the radio source are consistent with a magnetar
wind nebula or an off-axis jet, indicating the presence of a central engine.
Our directed search for FRBs from the location of PTF10hgi using 40 min of VLA
phased-array data reveals no detections to a limit of $22$ mJy ($10\sigma$; 10
ms duration). We outline several follow-up observations that can conclusively
establish the origin of the radio emission.

We develop a sophisticated model of FRB observations, accounting for the
intrinsic cosmological gas distribution and host galaxy contributions, and give
the most detailed account yet of observational biases due to burst width,
dispersion measure, and the exact telescope beamshape. Our results offer a
significant increase in both accuracy and precision beyond those previously
obtained. Using results from ASKAP and Parkes, we present our best-fit FRB
population parameters in a companion paper. Here, we consider in detail the
expected and fitted distributions in redshift, dispersion measure, and
signal-to-noise. We estimate that the unlocalised ASKAP FRBs arise from
$z<0.5$, with between a third and a half within $z<0.1$. Our predicted
source-counts ("logN--logS") distribution confirms previous indications of a
steepening index near the Parkes detection threshold of $1$\,Jy\,ms. We find no
evidence for a minimum FRB energy, and rule out $E_{\rm min} > 10^{38.5}$\,erg
at 90\% C.L. Importantly, we find that above a certain DM, observational biases
cause the Macquart (DM--z) relation to become inverted, implying that the
highest-DM events detected in the unlocalised Parkes and ASKAP samples are
unlikely to be the most distant. We do not expect our quantitative estimates in
this region to be accurate until it is directly probed with localised FRBs.
Since the cause of this effect is a well-understood observational bias however,
it is guaranteed to be present to some degree. Works assuming a 1--1 DM--z
relation may therefore derive erroneous results.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely powerful sources of radio waves
observed at cosmological distances. We use a sophisticated model of FRB
observations -- presented in detail in a companion paper -- to fit FRB
population parameters using large samples of FRBs detected by ASKAP and Parkes,
including seven sources with confirmed host galaxies. Our fitted parameters
demonstrate that the FRB population evolves with redshift in a manner
consistent with, or faster than, the star-formation rate (SFR), ruling out a
non-evolving population at 99.9\% C.L. Our estimated maximum FRB energy is
$\log_{10} E_{\rm max} [{\rm erg}] = 41.84_{-0.18}^{+0.49}$ (68\% C.L.)
assuming a 1\,GHz emission bandwidth, with slope of the cumulative luminosity
distribution $\gamma=-1.16_{-0.12}^{+0.11}$. We find a log-mean host DM
contribution of $145_{-60}^{+64}$\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$ on top of a typical local (ISM
and halo) contribution of $\sim80$\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$, which is higher than most
literature values. These results are consistent with the model of FRBs arising
as the high-energy limit of magnetar bursts, but allow for FRB progenitors that
evolve faster than the SFR.

Magnetars are a promising candidate for the origin of Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs). The detection of an extremely luminous radio burst from the Galactic
magnetar SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 added credence to this hypothesis. We
report on simultaneous and non-simultaneous observing campaigns using the
Arecibo, Effelsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2 and Northern Cross radio telescopes
and the MeerLICHT optical telescope in the days and months after the April 28
event. We did not detect any significant single radio pulses down to fluence
limits between 25 mJy ms and 18 Jy ms. Some observing epochs overlapped with
times when X-ray bursts were detected. Radio images made on four days using the
MeerKAT telescope revealed no point-like persistent or transient emission at
the location of the magnetar. No transient or persistent optical emission was
detected over seven days. Using the multi-colour MeerLICHT images combined with
relations between DM, NH and reddening we constrain the distance to SGR
J1935+2154, to be between 1.5 and 6.5 kpc. The upper limit is consistent with
some other distance indicators and suggests that the April 28 burst is closer
to two orders of magnitude less energetic than the least energetic FRBs. The
lack of single-pulse radio detections shows that the single pulses detected
over a range of fluences are either rare, or highly clustered, or both. It may
also indicate that the magnetar lies somewhere between being radio-quiet and
radio-loud in terms of its ability to produce radio emission efficiently.

The period in which hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is ionized,
known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is still poorly understood. The timing
and duration of the EoR is expected to be governed by the underlying
astrophysics. Furthermore, most models of reionization predict a correlation
between the density and ionization field. Here we consider using the mean
dispersion measure (DM) of high redshift Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a probe of
the underlying astrophysics and morphology of the EoR. To do this, we forecast
observational scenarios by building mock data sets of non-repeating FRBs
between redshifts $8\leq z \leq 10$. It is assumed that all FRBs have
accompanying spectroscopic redshift measurements. We find that samples of 100
high redshift FRBs, in the above mentioned narrow redshift range, can rule out
uncorrelated reionization at $68\%$ credibility, while larger samples, $\geq
10^4$ FRBs, can rule out uncorrelated reionization at $95\%$ credibility. We
also find 100 high redshift FRBs can rule out scenarios where the Universe is
entirely neutral at $z = 10$ with $68\%$ credibility. Further with $\geq 10^5$
FRBs, we can constrain the duration $\Delta z$ of reionization (duration
between mean ionized fraction 0.25 to 0.75) to $\Delta z = 2.0^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$,
and the midpoint of reionization to $z = 7.8^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ at $95\%$
credibility.

FRB 20180916B is a well-studied repeating fast radio burst source. Its
proximity (~150 Mpc), along with detailed studies of the bursts, have revealed
many clues about its nature -- including a 16.3-day periodicity in its
activity. Here we report on the detection of 18 bursts using LOFAR at 110-188
MHz, by far the lowest-frequency detections of any FRB to date. Some bursts are
seen down to the lowest-observed frequency of 110 MHz, suggesting that their
spectra extend even lower. These observations provide an order-of-magnitude
stronger constraint on the optical depth due to free-free absorption in the
source's local environment. The absence of circular polarization and nearly
flat polarization angle curves are consistent with burst properties seen at
300-1700 MHz. Compared with higher frequencies, the larger burst widths
(~40-160 ms at 150 MHz) and lower linear polarization fractions are likely due
to scattering. We find ~2-3 rad/m^2 variations in the Faraday rotation measure
that may be correlated with the activity cycle of the source. We compare the
LOFAR burst arrival times to those of 38 previously published and 22 newly
detected bursts from the uGMRT (200-450 MHz) and CHIME/FRB (400-800 MHz).
Simultaneous observations show 5 CHIME/FRB bursts when no emission is detected
by LOFAR. We find that the burst activity is systematically delayed towards
lower frequencies by ~3 days from 600 MHz to 150 MHz. We discuss these results
in the context of a model in which FRB 20180916B is an interacting binary
system featuring a neutron star and high-mass stellar companion.

Fast radio bursts are bright, millisecond-scale radio flashes of yet unknown
physical origin. Recently, their extragalactic nature has been demonstrated and
an increasing number of the sources have been found to repeat. Young, highly
magnetized, isolated neutron stars - magnetars - have been suggested as the
most promising candidates for fast radio burst progenitors owing to their
energetics and high X-ray flaring activity. Here we report the detection with
the Konus-Wind of a hard X-ray event of April 28, 2020, temporarily coincident
with a bright, two-peak radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935+2154
with properties remarkably similar to those of fast radio bursts. We show that
two peaks of the double-peaked X-ray burst coincide in time with the radio
peaks, confirming that the X-ray and radio emission most likely have a common
origin. Thus, this is the first simultaneous detection of a fast radio burst
from a Galactic magnetar and its high-energy counterpart. The total energy
emitted in X-rays in this burst is typical of bright short magnetar bursts, but
an unusual hardness of its energy spectrum strongly distinguish the April 28
event among multiple "ordinary" flares detected from SGR~1935+2154 previously.
This, and a recent non-detection of radio emission from about one hundred
typical soft bursts from SGR 1935+2154 favors the idea that bright, FRB-like
magnetar signals are associated with rare, hard-spectrum X-ray bursts, which
implied rate ($\sim$ 0.04 yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$) appears consistent with
the rate estimate of SGR 1935+2154-like radio bursts (0.007 - 0.04 yr$^{-1}$
magnetar$^{-1}$).

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are recently discovered mysterious single pulses of
radio emission, mostly coming from cosmological distances ($\sim 1$ Gpc). Their
short duration, $\sim 1$ ms, and large luminosity evidence coherent emission. I
review the basic physics of coherent emission mechanisms proposed for FRBs. In
particular, I discuss the curvature emission of bunches, the synchrotron maser,
and the emission of radio waves by variable currents in the course of magnetic
reconnection. Special attention is paid to magnetar flares as the most
promising sources of FRBs. Non-linear effects are outlined that could place
bounds on the power of the outgoing radiation.

The two radio pulses (TRPs) from SGR 1935+2154 detected by \cite{BKRMHB} and
\cite{2020arXiv200510324T} have similar features to that of cosmological fast
radio bursts (FRBs). Many authors directly call the TRPs as FRB 200428 without
consider two questions carefully. (1) Are the TRPs just two brighter subpulses
of a normal radio pulse liking the normal radio pulses seen in other magnetars
during their outburst? (2) If the TRPs are two bursts of an FRB, does this make
other FRBs difficult to understand? In this paper, we try to clarify these two
questions. First, we compare these TRPs with previous observations of normal
radio pulses from pulsars and magnetars, and find that the TRPs should be
produced by different mechanism from that of normal radio pulses. We then
investigate the second question by assuming the TRPs have the same origin as
that of periodically repeating FRBs and find that the origin of the periodicity
of periodically repeating FRBs should not be induced by precession. Otherwise,
we should expect that the TRPs are not an FRB, at least the TRPs don't have the
same origin as that of periodically repeating FRBs.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astrophysical transients of still debated
origin. So far several hundred events have been detected, mostly at
extragalactic distances, and this number is expected to grow significantly over
the next years. The radio signals from the burst experience dispersion as they
travel through the free electrons along the line-of-sight characterised by the
dispersion measure (DM) of the radio pulse. In addition, each photon also
experiences a gravitational Shapiro time delay while travelling through the
potentials generated by the large-scale structure. If the equivalence principle
(EP) holds, the Shapiro delay is the same for photons of all frequencies. In
case the EP is broken, one would expect an additional dispersion to occur which
could be either positive or negative for individual sources. Here we suggest to
use angular statistics of the DM fluctuations to put constraints on the EP
parametrized by the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$. Previous studies suffer
from the problem that the gravitational potential responsible for the delay
diverges in a cosmological setting, which our approach avoids. We carry out a
forecast for a population of FRBs observable within the next years and show
that any significant detection of the DM angular power spectrum will place
constraints on the EP that are by a few orders of magnitude more stringent than
current limits.

We introduce a new method to estimate the probability that an extragalactic
transient source is associated with a candidate host galaxy. This approach
relies solely on simple observables: sky coordinates and their uncertainties,
galaxy fluxes and angular sizes. The formalism invokes Bayes' rule to calculate
the posterior probability P(O_i|x) from the galaxy prior P(O), observables x,
and an assumed model for the true distribution of transients in/around their
host galaxies. Using simulated transients placed in the well-studied COSMOS
field, we consider several agnostic and physically motivated priors and offset
distributions to explore the method sensitivity. We then apply the methodology
to the set of 13~fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized with an uncertainty of
several arcseconds. Our methodology finds nine of these are securely associated
to a single host galaxy, P(O_i|x)>0.95. We examine the observed and intrinsic
properties of these secure FRB hosts, recovering similar distributions as
previous works. Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the apparent
magnitude of the securely identified host galaxies and the estimated cosmic
dispersion measures of the corresponding FRBs, which results from the Macquart
relation. Future work with FRBs will leverage this relation and other measures
from the secure hosts as priors for future associations. The methodology is
generic to transient type, localization error, and image quality. We encourage
its application to other transients where host galaxy associations are critical
to the science, e.g. gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and
supernovae. We have encoded the technique in Python on GitHub:
https://github.com/FRBs/astropath.

We report three new FRBs discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture
Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), namely FRB 181017.J0036+11, FRB 181118 and
FRB 181130, through the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS).
Together with FRB 181123 that was reported earlier, all four FAST-discovered
FRBs share the same characteristics of low fluence ($\leq$0.2 Jy ms) and high
dispersion measure (DM, $>1000$ \dmu), consistent with the anti-correlation
between DM and fluence of the entire FRB population. FRB 181118 and FRB 181130
exhibit band-limited features. FRB 181130 is prominently scattered
($\tau_s\simeq8$ ms) at 1.25 GHz. FRB 181017.J0036+11 has full-bandwidth
emission with a fluence of 0.042 Jy ms, which is one of the faintest FRB
sources detected so far. CRAFTS starts to built a new sample of FRBs that fills
the region for more distant and fainter FRBs in the fluence-$\rm DM_E$ diagram,
previously out of reach of other surveys. The implied all sky event rate of
FRBs is $1.24^{+1.94}_{-0.90} \times 10^5$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at the $95\%$
confidence interval above 0.0146 Jy ms. We also demonstrate here that the
probability density function of CRAFTS FRB detections is sensitive to the
assumed intrinsic FRB luminosity function and cosmological evolution, which may
be further constrained with more discoveries.

The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has become a
leading facility for detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) through the CHIME/FRB
backend. CHIME/FRB searches for fast transients in polarization-summed
intensity data streams that have 24-kHz spectral and 1-ms temporal resolution.
The intensity beams are pointed to pre-determined locations in the sky. A
triggered baseband system records the coherent electric field measured by each
antenna in the CHIME array at the time of FRB detections. Here we describe the
analysis techniques and automated pipeline developed to process these
full-array baseband data recordings. Whereas the real-time FRB detection
pipeline has a localization limit of several arcminutes, offline analysis of
baseband data yields source localizations with sub-arcminute precision, as
characterized by using a sample of pulsars and one repeating FRB with known
positions. The baseband pipeline also enables resolving temporal substructure
on a micro-second scale and the study of polarization including detections of
Faraday rotation.

Fast Radio Burst FRB 20180916B in its host galaxy SDSS J015800.28+654253.0 at
149 Mpc is by far the closest-known FRB with a robust host galaxy association.
The source also exhibits a 16.35-day period in its bursting. Here we present
optical and infrared imaging as well as integral field spectroscopy
observations of FRB 20180916B with the WFC3 camera on the Hubble Space
Telescope and the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias.
The 60-90 milliarcsecond (mas) resolution of the Hubble imaging, along with the
previous 2.3-mas localization of FRB 20180916B, allow us to probe its
environment with a 30-60 pc resolution. We constrain any point-like
star-formation or HII region at the location of FRB 20180916B to have an
H$\alpha$ luminosity $L_\mathrm{H\alpha} \lesssim
10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and, correspondingly, constrain the local
star-formation rate to be $\lesssim10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The
constraint on H$\alpha$ suggests that possible stellar companions to FRB
20180916B should be of a cooler, less massive spectral type than O6V. FRB
20180916B is 250 pc away (in projected distance) from the brightest pixel of
the nearest young stellar clump, which is $\sim380$\,pc in size (full-width at
half maximum). With the typical projected velocities of pulsars, magnetars, or
neutron stars in binaries (60-750 km s$^{-1}$), FRB 20180916B would need 800
kyr to 7 Myr to traverse the observed distance from its presumed birth site.
This timescale is inconsistent with the active ages of magnetars ($\lesssim10$
kyr). Rather, the inferred age and observed separation are compatible with the
ages of high-mass X-ray binaries and gamma-ray binaries, and their separations
from the nearest OB associations.

Revealing the cosmic reionisation history is at the frontier of extragalactic
astronomy. The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
polarisation can be used to constrain the reionisation history. Here we propose
a CMB-independent method using fast radio bursts (FRBs) to directly measure the
ionisation fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) as a function of
redshift. FRBs are new astronomical transients with millisecond timescales.
Their dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm IGM}$) is an indicator of the amount of
ionised material in the IGM. Since the differential of DM$_{\rm IGM}$ against
redshift is proportional to the ionisation fraction, our method allows us to
directly measure the reionisation history without any assumption on its
functional shape. As a proof of concept, we constructed mock non-repeating FRB
sources to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array, assuming three
different reionisation histories with the same optical depth of Thomson
scattering. We considered three cases of redshift measurements: (A)
spectroscopic redshift for all mock data, (B) spectroscopic redshift for 10% of
mock data, and (C) redshift estimated from an empirical relation of FRBs
between their time-integrated luminosity and rest-frame intrinsic duration. In
all cases, the reionisation histories are consistently reconstructed from the
mock FRB data using our method. Our results demonstrate the capability of
future FRBs in constraining the reionisation history.

We have investigated the basic statistics of the cosmological dispersion
measure (DM) -- such as its mean, variance, probability distribution, angular
power spectrum and correlation function -- using the state-of-the-art
hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG300, for the fast radio burst (FRB)
cosmology. To model the DM statistics, we first measured the free-electron
abundance and the power spectrum of its spatial fluctuations. The free-electron
power spectrum turns out to be consistent with the dark matter power spectrum
at large scales, but it is strongly damped at small scales ($\lesssim 1$Mpc)
owing to the stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback. The free-electron
power spectrum is well modelled using a scale-dependent bias factor (the ratio
of its fluctuation amplitude to that of the dark matter). We provide analytical
fitting functions for the free-electron abundance and its bias factor. We next
constructed mock sky maps of the DM by performing standard ray-tracing
simulations with the TNG300 data. The DM statistics are calculated analytically
from the fitting functions of the free-electron distribution, which agree well
with the simulation results measured from the mock maps. We have also obtained
the probability distribution of source redshift for a given DM, which helps in
identifying the host galaxies of FRBs from the measured DMs. The angular
two-point correlation function of the DM is described by a simple power law,
$\xi(\theta) \approx 2400 (\theta/{\rm deg})^{-1} \, {\rm pc}^2 \, {\rm
cm}^{-6}$, which we anticipate will be confirmed by future observations when
thousands of FRBs are available.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11643v2
We describe three different methods for exploring the hydrogen reionization
epoch using fast radio bursts (FRBs) and provide arguments for the existence of
FRBs at high redshift (z). The simplest way, observationally, is to determine
the maximum dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm max}$) of FRBs for an ensemble that
includes bursts during the reionization. The DM$_{\rm max}$ provides
information regarding reionization much like the optical depth of the CMB to
Thomson scattering does, and it has the potential to be more accurate than
constraints from Planck, if DM$_{\rm max}$ can be measured to a precision
better than 500 $\mbox{pc cm}^{-3}$. Another method is to measure redshifts of
about 40 FRBs between z of 6-10 with$\sim10\%$ accuracy to obtain the average
electron density in 4 different z-bins with $\sim4\%$ accuracy. These two
methods don't require knowledge of the FRB luminosity function and its possible
redshift evolution. Finally, we show that the reionization history is reflected
in the number of FRBs per unit DM, given a fluence limited survey of FRBs that
includes bursts during the reionization epoch; we show using FIRE simulations
that the contributions to DM from the FRB host galaxy $\&$ CGM during the
reionization era is a small fraction of the observed DM. This third method
requires no redshift information but does require knowledge of the FRB
luminosity function.

The repeating fast radio burst source FRB 121102 has been shown to have an
exceptionally high and variable Faraday rotation measure (RM), which must be
imparted within its host galaxy and likely by or within its local environment.
In the redshifted ($z=0.193$) source reference frame, the RM decreased from
$1.46\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ to $1.33\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ between January
and August 2017, showing day-timescale variations of $\sim200$~rad~m$^{-2}$.
Here we present sixteen FRB 121102 RMs from burst detections with the Arecibo
305-m radio telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array, providing a record of FRB 121102's RM over a 2.5-year timespan. Our
observations show a decreasing trend in RM, although the trend is not linear,
dropping by an average of 15\% year$^{-1}$ and is
$\sim9.7\times10^4$~rad~m$^{-2}$ at the most recent epoch of August 2019.
Erratic, short-term RM variations of $\sim10^3$~rad~m$^{-2}$ week$^{-1}$ were
also observed between MJDs 58215--58247. A decades-old neutron star embedded
within a still-compact supernova remnant or a neutron star near a massive black
hole and its accretion torus have been proposed to explain the high RMs. We
compare the observed RMs to theoretical models describing the RM evolution for
FRBs originating within a supernova remnant. FRB 121102's age is unknown, and
we find that the models agree for source ages of $\sim6-17$~years at the time
of the first available RM measurements in 2017. We also draw comparisons to the
decreasing RM of the Galactic center magnetar, PSR J1745--2900.

The environments of explosive transients link their progenitors to the
underlying stellar population, providing critical clues for their origins.
However, some Ca-rich supernovae (SNe) and short gamma ray burst (sGRBs) appear
to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their
host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical
evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large
velocity kicks were imparted to their progenitors, allowing them to propagate
to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in
dense globular clusters residing in the halos. Here we show that instead, the
large spatial-offsets of these transients are naturally explained by the
observations of highly extended underlying stellar populations in (mostly early
type) galaxy halos, typically missed since they can only be identified through
ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, no large velocity kicks, nor halo
globular cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of
these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on
white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and
no/small-natal-kicks given to sGRB progenitors. Since early-type galaxies
contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar
populations would have larger fractions of early-type galaxy hosts, and
consequently larger fractions of transients at large offsets. This is verified
by our results for sGRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions
in early vs. late-type galaxies. Furthermore, once divided between early and
late type galaxies, the offsets' distributions of the different transients are
consistent with each other. Finally, we point out that studies of other
transients' offset distribution (e.g. Ia-SNe or FRBs) should similarly consider
the host galaxy-type.

Magnetars are highly magnetized neutron stars that are characterized by
recurrent emission of short-duration bursts in soft gamma-rays/hard X-rays.
Recently, FRB 200428 were found to be associated with an X-ray burst from a
Galactic magnetar. Two fast radio bursts (FRBs) show mysterious periodic
activity. However, whether magnetar X-ray bursts are periodic phenomena is
unclear. In this paper, we investigate the period of SGR 1806-20 activity. More
than 3000 short bursts observed by different telescopes are collected,
including the observation of RXTE, HETE-2, ICE and Konus. We consider the
observation windows and divide the data into two sub-samples to alleviate the
effect of unevenly sample. The epoch folding and Lomb-Scargle methods are used
to derive the period of short bursts. We find a possible period about $ 398.20
\pm 25.45 $ days. While other peaks exist in the periodograms. If the period is
real, the connection between short bursts of magnetars and FRBs should be
extensively investigated.

We report polarization properties for eight narrowband bursts from FRB 121102
that have been re-detected in a high-frequency (4-8 GHz) Breakthrough Listen
observation with the Green Bank Telescope, originally taken on 2017 August 26.
The bursts were found to exhibit nearly 100% linear polarization, Faraday
rotation measures (RM) bordering 9.3$\times$10$^4$ rad-m$^{-2}$, and stable
polarization position angles (PA), all of which agree with burst properties
previously reported for FRB 121102 at the same epoch. We confirm that these
detections are indeed physical bursts with limited spectral occupancies and
further support the use of sub-banded search techniques in FRB detection.

High-precision cosmological probes have revealed a small but significant
tension between the parameters measured with different techniques, among which
there is one based on time delays in gravitational lenses. We discuss a new way
of using time delays for cosmology, taking advantage of the extreme precision
expected for lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are short flashes of radio
emission originating at cosmological distances. With coherent methods, the
achievable precision is sufficient for measuring how time delays change over
the months and years, which can also be interpreted as differential redshifts
between the images. It turns out that uncertainties arising from the unknown
mass distribution of gravitational lenses can be eliminated by combining time
delays with their time derivatives. Other effects, most importantly relative
proper motions, can be measured accurately and disentangled from the
cosmological effects. With a mock sample of simulated lenses, we show that it
may be possible to attain strong constraints on cosmological parameters.
Finally, the lensed images can be used as galactic interferometer to resolve
structures and motions of the burst sources with incredibly high resolution and
help reveal their physical nature, which is currently unknown.

Recent observations of the periodic Fast Radio Burst source 180916.J0158+65
(FRB 180916) find small linear polarization position angle swings during and
between bursts, with a burst activity window that becomes both narrower and
earlier at higher frequencies. Although the observed chromatic activity window
disfavors models of periodicity in FRB 180916 driven by the occultation of a
neutron star by the optically-thick wind from a stellar companion, the
connection to theories where periodicity arises from the motion of a bursting
magnetar remains unclear. In this paper, we show how altitude-dependent radio
emission from magnetar curvature radiation, with bursts emitted from regions
which are asymmetric with respect to the magnetic dipole axis, can lead to
burst activity windows and polarization consistent with the recent
observations. In particular, the fact that bursts arrive systematically earlier
at higher frequencies disfavors theories where the FRB periodicity arises from
forced precession of a magnetar by a companion or fallback disk, but is
consistent with theories where periodicity originates from a slowly-rotating or
freely-precessing magnetar. Several observational tests are proposed to
verify/differentiate between the remaining theories, and pin-down which theory
explains the periodicity in FRB 180916.

Accompanied by an X-ray burst, the fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 was
recently confirmed as originating from the Galactic magnetar soft gamma
repeater (SGR) SGR J1935+2154. Just before and after FRB 200428 was detected,
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) had been
monitoring SGR J1935+2154 for eight hours. From UTC 2020 April 27 23:55:00 to
2020 April 28 00:50:37, FAST detected no pulsed radio emission from SGR
J1935+2154, while Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor registered 34 bursts in the
X/soft $\gamma$-ray band, forming a unique sample of X-ray bursts in the
absence of FRBs. After a comprehensive analysis on light curves,
time-integrated, and time-resolved spectral properties of these FRB-absent
X-ray bursts, we compare this sample with the FRB-associated X-ray burst
detected by Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL, and Konus-Wind. The FRB-associated burst
distinguishes itself from other X-ray bursts by its nonthermal spectrum and a
higher spectral peak energy, but otherwise is not atypical. We also compare the
cumulative energy distribution of our X-ray burst sample with that of first
repeating FRB source, FRB 121102, with the calibration of FRB 200428-X-ray
burst association. We find a similarity between the two, offering indirect
support of the magnetar origin of cosmological FRBs. The event rate density of
magnetar bursts is about $\sim 150$ times higher than the FRB event rate
density at the energy of FRB 200428. This again suggests that, if all FRBs
originate from magnetars, only a small fraction of X-ray bursts are associated
with FRBs.

In 2007, a very bright radio pulse was identified in the archival data of the
Parkes Telescope in Australia, marking the beginning of a new research branch
in astrophysics. In 2013, this kind of millisecond bursts with extremely high
brightness temperature takes a unified name, fast radio burst (FRB). Over the
first few years, FRBs seemed very mysterious because the sample of known events
was limited. With the improvement of instruments over the last five years,
hundreds of new FRBs have been discovered. The field is now undergoing a
revolution and understanding of FRB has rapidly increased as new observational
data increasingly accumulates. In this review, we will summarize the basic
physics of FRBs and discuss the current research progress in this area. We have
tried to cover a wide range of FRB topics, including the observational
property, propagation effect, population study, radiation mechanism, source
model, and application in cosmology. A framework based on the latest
observational facts is now under construction. In the near future, this
exciting field is expected to make significant breakthroughs.

The Parkes, ASKAP, CHIME and UTMOST telescopes, which have all detected FRBs,
each works at a different frequency and has a different detection criteria.
Using simulations, we have combined the constraints from all four telescopes to
identify an allowed range of model parameters $(\alpha, \E33)$ for the FRB
source population. Here $\alpha$ is the spectral index and $\E33$ is the mean
FRB energy in units of $10^{33} \, {\rm J}$ across a $2128 - 2848\; {\rm MHz}$
band in the FRB rest frame. We have considered several different FRB energy
distributions, and also different scenarios for the scattering pulse
broadening, the event rate density variation with $z$ and the host dispersion
measure. We find that in all cases, the common allowed region includes the
range $-3.9\leq\alpha\leq-1.3$ and $0.42\leq\E33\leq1$. In all case, large
values $\alpha > 4$ and $\E33 >60$ are ruled out. Considering the allowed
$(\alpha, \E33)$ parameter range, we predict that CHIME is unlikely to detect
an FRB with extra-galactic dispersion measure $(DM_{Ex})$ exceeding $3700\,{\rm
pc\,cm}^{-3}$. A substantially larger $DM_{Ex}$ in the large FRB sample
anticipated from CHIME would falsify the assumptions of the present analysis.
Our analysis is expected to yield tighter parameter constraints with the advent
of more FRB data.

Magnetars are young, magnetically-powered neutron stars possessing the
strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are
extremely intense millisecond-long radio pulses of primarily extragalactic
origin, and a leading attribution for their genesis focuses on magnetars. A
hallmark signature of magnetars is their emission of bright, hard X-ray bursts
of sub-second duration. On April 27th 2020, the Galactic magnetar SGR
J1935+2154 emitted hundreds of X-ray bursts in a few hours. One of these
temporally coincided with an FRB, the first detection of an FRB from the Milky
Way. Here we present spectral and temporal analyses of 24 X-ray bursts emitted
13 hours prior to the FRB and seen simultaneously with the NASA NICER and
Fermi/GBM missions in their combined energy range, 0.2 keV-30 MeV. These
broadband spectra permit direct comparison with the spectrum of the
FRB-associated X-ray burst (FRB-X). We demonstrate that all 24 NICER/GBM bursts
are very similar temporally, albeit strikingly different spectrally, from
FRB-X. The singularity of the FRB-X burst is perhaps indicative of an uncommon
locale for its origin. We suggest that this event originated in quasi-polar
open or closed magnetic field lines that extend to high altitudes.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, coherent, short-duration radio
transients of as-yet unknown extragalactic origin. FRBs exhibit a wide variety
of spectral, temporal and polarimetric properties, which can unveil clues into
their emission physics and propagation effects in the local medium. Here we
present the high-time-resolution (down to 1 $\mu$s) polarimetric properties of
four 1.7-GHz bursts from the repeating FRB 20180916B, which were detected in
voltage data during observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN). We
observe a range of emission timescales spanning three orders of magnitude, with
the shortest component width reaching 3-4 $\mu$s (below which we are limited by
scattering). This is the shortest timescale measured in any FRB, to date. We
demonstrate that all four bursts are highly linearly polarised ($\gtrsim
80\%$), show no evidence for significant circular polarisation ($\lesssim
15\%$), and exhibit a constant polarisation position angle (PPA) during and
between bursts. On short timescales ($\lesssim 100$ $\mu$s), however, there
appear to be subtle (few degree) PPA variations across the burst profiles.
These observational results are most naturally explained in an FRB model where
the emission is magnetospheric in origin, as opposed to models where the
emission originates at larger distances in a relativistic shock.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15051v1
We compare the dispersion measure (DM) statistics of FRBs detected by the
ASKAP and Parkes radio telescopes. We jointly model their DM distributions,
exploiting the fact that the telescopes have different survey fluence limits
but likely sample the same underlying population. After accounting for the
effects of instrumental temporal and spectral resolution of each sample, we
find that a fit between the modelled and observed DM distribution, using
identical population parameters, provides a good fit to both distributions.
Assuming a one-to-one mapping between DM and redshift for an homogeneous
intergalactic medium (IGM), we determine the best-fit parameters of the
population spectral index, $\hat{\alpha}$, and the power-law index of the burst
energy distribution, $\hat{\gamma}$, for different redshift evolutionary
models. Whilst the overall best-fit model yields
$\hat{\alpha}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+0.7}$ and $\hat{\gamma}=2.0_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$, for a
strong redshift evolutionary model, when we admit the further constraint of
$\alpha=1.5$ we favour the best fit $\hat{\gamma}=1.5 \pm 0.2$ and the case of
no redshift evolution. Moreover, we find no evidence that the FRB population
evolves faster than linearly with respect to the star formation rate over the
DM (redshift) range for the sampled population.

The nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is currently unknown. Repeating FRBs
offer better opportunity than non-repeating FRBs since their simultaneous
multi-wavelength counterparts might be identified. The magnetar flare model of
FRBs is one of the most promising models which predicts high energy emission in
addition to radio burst emission. To investigate such a possibility, we have
searched for simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous short-term hard X-ray bursts
in all the Swift/BAT event mode data which covered the periods when fast radio
bursts were reported detections in the repeating FRB 121102, by making use of
BAT's arcmin level spacial resolution and wide field-of-view. We did not find
any significant hard X-ray bursts which occurred simultaneously to those radio
bursts. We also investigated potential short X-ray bursts occurred
quasi-simultaneous with those radio bursts (occurrence time differs in the
range from hundreds of seconds to thousands of seconds) and concluded that even
the best candidates are consistent with background fluctuations. Therefore our
investigation concluded that there were no hard X-ray bursts detectable with
Swift/BAT which occurred simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously with those fast
radio bursts in the repeating FRB 121102.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09921v2
Recently, one fast radio burst, FRB 200428, was detected from the Galactic
magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one X-ray burst. This suggests that magnetars
can make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR
J1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason for such rarity of
FRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly
beamed than the SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is correct, one
would expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angles somewhat outside the
narrow emission beam. These "slow" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader
widths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. We
derive two "closure relations" to judge whether a long, less luminous radio
burst could be an SRB. The 2.2-s, 308 Jy ms, 111 MHz radio burst detected from
SGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB. The 2-ms, 60
mJy ms faint burst detected by FAST from the same source could be also an SRB
if the corresponding FRB has a narrow spectrum. If the FRB beam is narrow,
there should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. The lack of
detection of abundant SRBs from magnetars would disfavor the hypothesis that
all SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.

FRB 190608 was detected by ASKAP and localized to a spiral galaxy at
$z_{host}=0.11778$ in the SDSS footprint. The burst has a large dispersion
measure ($DM_{FRB}=339.8$ $pc/cm^3$) compared to the expected cosmic average at
its redshift. It also has a large rotation measure ($RM_{FRB}=353$ $rad/m^2$)
and scattering timescale ($\tau=3.3$ $ms$ at $1.28$ $GHz$). Chittidi et al
(2020) perform a detailed analysis of the ultraviolet and optical emission of
the host galaxy and estimate the host DM contribution to be $110\pm 37$
$pc/cm^3$. This work complements theirs and reports the analysis of the optical
data of galaxies in the foreground of FRB 190608 to explore their contributions
to the FRB signal. Together, the two manuscripts delineate an observationally
driven, end-to-end study of matter distribution along an FRB sightline; the
first study of its kind. Combining KCWI observations and public SDSS data, we
estimate the expected cosmic dispersion measure $DM_{cosmic}$ along the
sightline to FRB 190608. We first estimate the contribution of hot, ionized gas
in intervening virialized halos ($DM_{halos} \approx 7-28$ $pc/cm^3$). Then,
using the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) methodology, we produce a 3D map
of ionized gas in cosmic web filaments and compute the DM contribution from
matter outside halos ($DM_{IGM} \approx 91-126$ $pc/cm^3$). This implies a
greater fraction of ionized gas along this sightline is extant outside
virialized halos. We also investigate whether the intervening halos can account
for the large FRB rotation measure and pulse width and conclude that it is
implausible. Both the pulse broadening and the large Faraday rotation likely
arise from the progenitor environment or the host galaxy.

In less than a decade, fast radio bursts have gone from a single debated
curiosity to a diverse extragalactic population with established host galaxies
and energy scales. While a wide range of models remain viable, the central
engines of FRBs are likely to involve energetic young magnetars, as confirmed
by the recent discovery of a Galactic analog to these extragalactic bursts.
Here we provide a brief introductory review of fast radio bursts, focusing on
the rapid recent progress in observations of these enigmatic events, our
understanding of their central engines, and their use as probes of the
intergalactic medium. We caution against a rush to judgement on the mechanisms
and classification of all FRBs: at this point, it remains plausible that there
could be one dominant central engine, as well as the possibility that radio
bursts are a generic feature produced by many different mechanisms. We also
emphasize the importance of improved modeling of our Galaxy and Galactic halo,
which otherwise impose systematic errors on every FRB line of sight. The future
of science with fast radio bursts appears bright.

The detection of almost 100% linearly polarized emission from the fast radio
burst source FRB 121102 implies coherent emission of relativistic electrons
moving in perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The origin of such a
particle distribution is very intriguing. Given that FRB 121102 is likely
driven by a neutron star, we explored orbits of charged particles trapped in a
dipole magnetic field (the St\"ormer problem). Most previous studies focused on
particles with relatively low energies so that the guiding center approximation
may be applied. High energy particles usually have chaotic orbits except those
on a periodic orbit or near stable periodic orbits. Via evaluation of the
maximum Lyapunov exponent of orbits of particles launched from the equatorial
plane with an axial velocity (the angular velocity sets the length and energy
scales of the system), we found prominent regions of quasi-periodic orbits
around stable periodic orbits in the equatorial plane at high-energies.
Particles in these orbits oscillate around the equatorial plane and their
radial distance from the dipole can vary by a factor of/,2. Relativistic
electrons in such orbits may be responsible for the almost 100% polarized
emission from FRB 121102.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright milliseconds radio transients with large
dispersion measures. Recently, FRB 200428 was detected in temporal coincidence
with a hard X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which
supports that at least some FRBs are from magnetar activity. Interestingly, a
portion of X-ray flares from magnetar XTE J1810-197 and the Sun are also
accompanied by radio bursts. Many features of Galactic FRB 200428 and
cosmological FRBs resemble solar radio bursts. However, a common physical
origin among FRBs, magnetar radio pulses and solar radio bursts has not yet
been established. Here we report a universal correlation between X-ray
luminosity and radio luminosity over twenty orders of magnitude among solar
type III radio bursts, XTE J1810-197 and Galactic FRB 200428. This universal
correlation reveals that the energetic electrons which produce the X-ray flares
and those which cause radio emissions have a common origin, which can give
stringent limits on the generation process of radio bursts. Moreover, we find
similar occurrence frequency distributions of energy, duration and waiting time
for solar radio bursts, SGR 1935+2154 and repeating FRB 121102, which also
support the tight correlation and the X-ray flares temporally associated with
radio bursts. All of these distributions can be understood by avalanche models
of self-organized criticality systems. The universal correlation and
statistical similarities indicate that the Galactic FRB 200428 and FRBs seen at
cosmological distances can be treated as scaled-up solar radio bursts.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic astrophysical transients whose
brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic, yet compact enough to
produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far been
detected between 300 MHz and 8 GHz, but lower-frequency emission has remained
elusive. A subset of FRBs is known to repeat, and one of those sources, FRB
20180916B, does so with a 16.3 day activity period. Using simultaneous Apertif
and LOFAR data, we show that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 MHz, and that its
activity window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind
interaction models predict a narrower periodic activity window at lower
frequencies, which is the opposite of our observations. Our detections
establish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For
bursts of the same fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 MHz than at
1.4 GHz. Combining our results with previous upper-limits on the all-sky FRB
rate at 150 MHz, we find that there are 3-450 FRBs/sky/day above 50 Jy ms at
90% confidence. We are able to rule out the scenario in which companion winds
cause FRB periodicity. We also demonstrate that some FRBs live in clean
environments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation.

Asteroids orbiting into the highly magnetized and highly relativistic wind of
a pulsar offer a favourable configuration for repeating fast radio bursts
(FRB). The body in direct contact with the wind develops a trail formed of a
stationary Alfv\'en wave, called an \textit{Alfv\'en wing}. When an element of
wind crosses the Alfv\'en wing, it sees a rotation of the ambient magnetic
field that can cause radio-wave instabilities. In the observer's reference
frame, the waves are collimated in a very narrow range of directions, and they
have an extremely high intensity. A previous work, published in 2014, showed
that planets orbiting a pulsar can cause FRB when they pass in our line of
sight. We predicted periodic FRB. Since then random FRB repeaters have been
discovered. We present an upgrade of this theory where repeaters can be
explained by the interaction of smaller bodies with a pulsar wind. Considering
the properties of relativistic Alfv\'en wings attached to a body in the pulsar
wind, and taking thermal consideration into account we conduct a parametric
study. We find that FRBs, including the Lorimer burst (30 Jy), can be explained
by small size pulsar companions (1 to 10 km) between 0.03 and 1 AU from a
highly magnetized millisecond pulsar. Some sets of parameters are also
compatible with a magnetar. Our model is compatible with the high rotation
measure of FRB121102. The bunched timing of the FRBs is the consequence of a
moderate wind turbulence. As asteroid belt composed of less than 200 bodies
would suffice for the FRB occurrence rate measured with FRB121102. This model,
after the present upgrade, is compatible with the properties discovered since
its first publication in 2014, when repeating FRB were still unknown. It is
based on standard physics, and on common astrophysical objects that can be
found in any kind of galaxy. It requires $10^{10}$ times less power than
(common) isotropic-emission FRB models.

Since the discovery of FRB 200428 associated with the Galactic SGR 1935+2154,
magnetars are considered to power fast radio bursts (FRBs). It is widely
believed that magnetars could form by core-collapse (CC) explosions and compact
binary mergers, such as binary neutron star (BNS), binary white dwarfs (BWD),
and neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) mergers. Therefore, it is important to
distinguish the various progenitors. The expansion of the merger ejecta
produces a time-evolving dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that
can probe the local environments of FRBs. In this paper, we derive the scaling
laws for the DM and RM from ejecta with different dynamical structures (the
mass and energy distribution) in the uniform ambient medium (merger scenario)
and wind environment (CC scenario). We find that the DM and RM will increase in
the early phase, while DM will continue to grow slowly but RM will decrease in
the later phase in the merger scenario. We fit the DM and RM evolution of FRB
121102 simultaneously for the first time in the BNS merger scenario, and find
the source age is $ \sim9-10 $ yr when it was first detected in 2012, and the
ambient medium density is $ \sim 2.5-3.1 $ cm$ ^{-3} $. The large offsets of
some FRBs are consistent with BNS/NSWD channel. The population synthesis method
is used to estimate the rate of compact binary mergers. The rate of BWD mergers
is close to the observed FRB rate. Therefore, the progenitors of FRBs may not
be unique.

Neutron stars are likely surrounded by gas, debris, and asteroid belts.
Kozai-Lidov perturbations, induced by a distant, but gravitationally bound
companion, can trigger the infall of such orbiting bodies onto a central
compact object. These effects could lead to the emission of fast radio bursts
(FRBs), for example by asteroid-induced magnetic wake fields in the wind of the
compact object. A few percent of binary neutron star systems in the Universe,
such as neutron star-main sequence star, neutron star-white dwarf, double
neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems, can account for the observed
non-repeating FRB rates. More remarkably, we find that wide and close companion
orbits lead to non-repeating and repeating sources, respectively, and they
allow for one to compute a ratio between repeating and non-repeating sources of
a few percent, which is in close agreement with the observations. Three major
predictions can be made from our scenario, which can be tested in the coming
years: 1) most repeaters should stop repeating after a period between 10 years
to a few decades, as their asteroid belts become depleted; 2) some
non-repeaters could occasionally repeat, if we hit the short period tail of the
FRB period distribution; and 3) series of sub-Jansky level short radio bursts
could be observed as electromagnetic counterparts of the mergers of binary
neutron star systems.

There are some similarities between bursts of repeating fast radio bursts
(FRBs) and giant pulses (GPs) of pulsars. To explore possible relations between
them, we study the cumulative energy distributions of these two phenomena using
the observations of repeating FRB 121102 and the GPs of Crab pulsar. We find
that the power-law slope of GPs (with fluence $\geq$130 Jy ms) is
$2.85\pm0.10$. The energy distribution of FRB 121102 can be well fitted by a
smooth broken power-law function. For the bursts of FRB 121102 above the break
energy (1.22 $\times 10^{37}$ erg), the best-fitting slope is
$2.90_{-0.44}^{+0.55}$, similar to the index of GPs at the same observing
frequency ($\sim$1.4 GHz). We further discuss the physical origin of the
repeating FRB 121102 in the framework of the super GPs model. And we find that
the super GPs model involving a millisecond pulsar is workable and favored for
explaining FRB 121102 despite that the magnetar burst model is more popular.

Variations of the dispersion (DM) and rotation (RM) measures of FRB 121102
indicate magnetic fields $\sim$ 3--17 mG in the dispersing plasma. The electron
density may be $\sim 10^4\,$cm$^{-3}$. The observed time scales $\sim 1$ year
constrain the size of the plasma cloud. Increasing DM excludes simple models
involving an expanding supernova remnant, and the non-zero RM excludes
spherical symmetry. The varying DM and RM may be attributable to the motion of
plasma into or out of the line of sight or changing electron density within
slower-moving plasma. The extraordinarily large RM of FRB 121102 implies an
environment, and possibly also a formation process and source, qualitatively
different from those of other FRB. The comparable and comparably varying RM of
SGR/PSR J1745-2900 suggests it as an FRB candidate. An appendix discusses the
age of FRB 121102 in the context of a "Copernican Principle".

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright enigmatic radio pulses of roughly
millisecond duration that come from extragalactic distances. As part of the
MeerTRAP project, we use the MeerKAT telescope array in South Africa to search
for and localise those bursts to high precision in real-time. We aim to
pinpoint FRBs to their host galaxies and, thereby, to understand how they are
created. However, the transient nature of FRBs presents various challenges,
e.g. in system design, raw compute power and real-time communication, where the
real-time requirements are reasonably strict (a few tens of seconds). Rapid
data processing is essential for us to be able to retain high-resolution data
of the bursts, to localise them, and to minimise the delay for follow-up
observations. We give a short overview of the data analysis pipeline, describe
the challenges faced, and elaborate on our initial design and implementation of
a real-time triggering infrastructure for FRBs at the MeerKAT telescope.

The fast radio burst (FRB) population is observationally divided into sources
that have been observed to repeat and those that have not. There is tentative
evidence that the bursts from repeating sources have different properties than
the non-repeating ones. In order to determine the occurrence rate of repeating
sources and characterize the nature of repeat emission, we have been conducting
sensitive searches for repetitions from bursts detected with the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope,
using the recently commissioned Ultra-wideband Low (UWL) receiver system, over
a band spanning 0.7$-$4.0 GHz. We report the detection of a repeat burst from
the source of FRB 20190711A. The detected burst is 1 ms wide and has a
bandwidth of just 65 MHz. We find no evidence of any emission in the remaining
part of the 3.3 GHz UWL band. While the emission bandwidths of the ASKAP and
UWL bursts show $\nu^{-4}$ scaling consistent with a propagation effect, the
spectral occupancy is inconsistent with diffractive scintillation. This
detection rules out models predicting broad-band emission from the FRB
20190711A source and puts stringent constraints on the emission mechanism. The
low spectral occupancy highlights the importance of sub-banded search methods
in detecting FRBs.

We explore the prompt magnetar progenitor scenario in the context of fast
radio burst (FRB) host galaxies demographics and offset distributions.
Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of
$10^{15}$ G with a short decay lifetime of less than $10^4$ years. Due to their
extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies
according to their current star-formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize
that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume
to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host
galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and
compare it to observed properties from a sample of \nsecure\ secure FRB hosts.
We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at
$>95\%$ c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however,
this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing limited estimates
for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent
association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be
the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must
account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed
galactocentric offsets.

The observed Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population can be divided into one-off
and repeating FRB sources. Either this division is a true dichotomy of the
underlying sources, or selection effects and low activity prohibit us from
observing repeat pulses from all constituents making up the FRB source
population. We attempt to break this degeneracy through FRB population
synthesis. With that aim we extend frbpoppy, which earlier only handled one-off
FRBs, to also simulate repeaters. We next model the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment FRB survey (CHIME/FRB). Using this implementation, we
investigate the impact of luminosity functions on the observed dispersion
measure (DM) and distance distributions of both repeating and one-off FRBs. We
show that for a single, intrinsically repeating source population with a steep
luminosity function, selection effects should shape the DM distributions of
one-off and repeating FRB sources differently. This difference is not yet
observed. We next show how the repeater fraction over time can help in
determining the repetition rate of an intrinsic source population. We simulate
this fraction for CHIME/FRB, and show that a source population comprised solely
of repeating FRBs can describe CHIME/FRB observations with the use of a flat
luminosity function. From the outcome of these two methods we thus conclude
that all FRBs originate from a single and mostly uniform population of varying
repeaters. Within this population, the luminosity function cannot be steep, and
there must be minor differences in physical or behaviour parameters that
correlate with repeat rate.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02400v2
Observationally, fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be divided into repeating and
apparently non-repeating (one-off) ones. It is unclear whether all FRBs repeat
and whether there are genuine non-repeating FRBs. We attempt to address these
questions using Monte Carlo simulations. We define a parameter $T_c$ at which
the accumulated number of non-repeating sources becomes comparable to the total
number of the repeating sources, which is a good proxy to denote the intrinsic
repeater fraction among FRBs. Assuming that both types of sources exist and
that their burst energies follow power law distributions, we investigate how
the {\em observed} repeater fraction evolves with time for different
parameters. If the lifetime of repeaters is sufficiently long so that the
evolutionary effect can be neglected within the observational time span, unless
$T_c \rightarrow \infty$ (i.e. there is no genuine non-repeating FRB source)
the observed repeater fraction should increase with time first, reach a peak,
and then decline. The peak time $T_p$ and the peak fraction $F_{\rm r,obs,p}$
depend on $T_c$ and other repeating rate parameters. With the current data, we
pose a lower limit $T_c > 0.1$ d for reasonable parameter values. We predict
that future continuous monitoring of FRBs with CHIME or similar wide-field
radio telescopes would obtain an $F_{\rm r,obs}$ less than $0.04$. The
detection of a smaller peak value $F_{\rm r,obs,p}<0.04$ in the near future
would disfavor the ansatz that "all FRB sources repeat".

The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a unique way
to probe ionised baryons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Cosmological models
with different parameters lead to different DM-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$)
relations. Additionally, the over/under-dense regions in the IGM and the
circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies lead to scatter around the mean
$\mathrm{DM}-z$ relations. We have used the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to measure the mean $\mathrm{DM}-z$
relation and the scatter around it using over one billion lines-of-sight
between redshifts $0<z<3$. We investigated two techniques to estimate
line-of-sight DM: `pixel scrambling' and `box transformations'. We find that
using box transformations (a technique from the literature) causes strong
correlations due to repeated replication of structure. Comparing a linear and
non-linear model, we find that the non-linear model with cosmological
parameters, provides a better fit to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation. The
differences between these models are the most significant at low redshifts
($z<0.5$). The scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation is highly
asymmetric, especially at low redshift $\left(z<0.5\right)$, and becomes more
Gaussian as redshift approaches $z\sim3$, the limit of this study. The increase
in Gaussianity with redshift is indicative of the large scale structures that
is better probed with longer lines-of-sight. The minimum simulation size
suitable for investigations into the scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$
relation is 100~comoving~Mpc. The $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation measured in EAGLE is
available with an easy-to-use python interface in the open-source FRB redshift
estimation package FRUITBAT.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients and can be
used as a cosmological probe. However, the dispersion measure (DM) contributed
by intergalactic medium (IGM) is hard to be distinguished from other
components. In this paper, we use the IllustrisTNG simulation to realistically
estimate the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ up to $z\sim 9$. We find $DM_{\rm IGM} =
892^{+721}_{-270}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ at $z=1$. The probability distribution of
$DM_{\rm IGM}$ can be well fitted by a quasi-Gaussian function with a long
tail. The tail is caused by the structures along the line of sight in IGM.
Subtracting DM contributions from the Milky Way and host galaxy for localized
FRBs, the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ value is close to the derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$
relation. We also show the capability to constrain the cosmic reionization
history with the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs in the IllustrisTNG
universe. The derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation at high redshifts can be well
fitted by a $tanh$ reionization model with the reionization redshift $z=5.95$,
which is compatible with the reionization model used by the IllustrisTNG
simulation. The $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs also provides an
independent way to measure the optical depth of cosmic microwave background
(CMB). Our result can be used to derive the pseudo-redshifts of non-localized
FRBs for $DM_{\rm IGM}<4000$ \ \ pc cm$^{-3}$.

We present a re-analysis of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) data around
the radio detection of FRB 131104. Possible evidence of a gamma-ray counterpart
was presented by DeLaunay et al. However, based on our analysis using all the
available BAT data, no significant emission is found in either the temporal or
the image domain. We place a 5~sigma fluence upper limit of 3.3 $\times$
10$^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ and 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (15-150 keV)
with an integration time of 300 s assuming a simple power-law spectrum with
photon index of -1.2 and -2.0, respectively. Our result does not support the
association of this FRB with a high-energy counterpart, in agreement with
growing observational evidence that most FRBs are not associated to
catastrophic events such as gamma-ray bursts.

We have performed a multi-wavelength study of supernova remnant (SNR)
G57.2+0.8 and its environment. The SNR hosts the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which
emitted an extremely bright ms-duration radio burst on 2020 Apr 28 (The
Chime/Frb Collaboration et al. 2020; Bochenek et al. 2020). We used the 12CO
and 13CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Image Scroll Painting (MWISP) CO line
survey to search for molecular gas associated with G57.2+0.8, in order to
constrain the physical parameters (e.g., the distance) of the SNR and its
magnetar. We report that SNR G57.2+0.8 is likely impacting the molecular clouds
(MCs) at the local standard of rest (LSR) velocity V_{LSR} ~ 30 km/s and
excites a weak 1720 MHz OH maser with a peak flux density of 47 mJy/beam. The
chance coincidence of a random OH spot falling in the SNR is <12%, and the
OH-CO correspondence chance is 7% at the maser spot. This combines to give < 1%
false probability of the OH maser, suggesting a real maser detection. The LSR
velocity of the MCs places the SNR and magnetar at a kinematic distance of
d=6.6 +/- 0.7 kpc. The nondetection of thermal X-ray emission from the SNR and
the relatively dense environment suggests G57.2+0.8 be an evolved SNR with an
age $t>1.6 \times 10^4$ (d/6.6 kpc) yr. The explosion energy of G57.2+0.8 is
lower than $2 \times 10^{51}(n_0/10 cm^{-3})^{1.16} (d/~6.6 kpc)^{3.16}$ erg,
which is not very energetic even assuming a high ambient density $n_0$ = 10
cm$^{-3}$. This reinforces the opinion that magnetars do not necessarily result
from very energetic supernova explosions.

At the time of defining the science objectives of the INTernational Gamma-Ray
Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), such a rapid and spectacular development of
multi-messenger astronomy could not have been predicted, with new impulsive
phenomena becoming accessible through different channels.
  Neutrino telescopes have routinely detected energetic neutrino events coming
from unknown cosmic sources since 2013. Gravitational wave detectors opened a
novel window on the sky in 2015 with the detection of the merging of two black
holes and in 2017 with the merging of two neutron stars, followed by signals in
the full electromagnetic range. Finally, since 2007, radio telescopes detected
extremely intense and short burst of radio waves, known as Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs) whose origin is for most cases extragalactic, but enigmatic.
  The exceptionally robust and versatile design of the INTEGRAL mission has
allowed researchers to exploit data collected not only with the pointed
instruments, but also with the active cosmic-ray shields of the main
instruments to detect impulses of gamma-rays in coincidence with unpredictable
phenomena. The full-sky coverage, mostly unocculted by the Earth, the large
effective area, the stable background, and the high duty cycle (85%) put
INTEGRAL in a privileged position to give a major contribution to
multi-messenger astronomy.
  In this review, we describe how INTEGRAL has provided upper limits on the
gamma-ray emission from black-hole binary mergers, detected a short gamma-ray
burst in coincidence with a binary neutron star merger, contributed to define
the spectral energy distribution of a blazar associated with a neutrino event,
set upper limits on impulsive and steady gamma-ray emission from cosmological
FRBs, and detected a magnetar flare associated with fast radio bursting
emission.

Very recently a fast radio burst (FRB) 200428 associated with a strong X-ray
burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has been detected, which is
direct evidence supporting the magnetar progenitor models of FRBs. Assuming the
FRB radiation mechanism is synchrotron maser emission from magnetized shocks,
we develop a specific scenario by introducing a density jump structure of
upstream medium, and thus the double-peaked character of FRB 200428 is a
natural outcome. The luminosity and emission frequency of two pulses can be
well explained in this scenario. Furthermore, we find that the synchrotron
emission of shock-accelerated electrons is in the X-ray band, which therefore
can be responsible for at least a portion of observed X-ray fluence. With
proper upgrade, this density jump scenario can be potentially applied to FRBs
with multiple peaks in the future.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients from
cosmological distances. Their isotropic energies follow a power-law
distribution with a possible exponential cutoff, but their intrinsic redshift
distribution, which contains information about the FRB sources, is not well
understood. We attempt to constrain both distributions by means of Monte Carlo
simulations and comparing the simulations results with the available FRB
specific fluence distribution, dispersion measure (DM) distribution, and the
estimated energy distribution data. Two redshift distribution models, one
tracking the star formation history of the universe and another tracking
compact binary mergers, are tested. For the latter model, we consider three
merger delay timescale distribution (Gaussian, log-normal, and power law)
models. Two FRB samples detected by Parkes and the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), respectively, are used to confront the simulation
results. We confirm the $\sim -1.8$ power law index for the energy distribution
but the exponential cutoff energy of the distribution, if any, is
unconstrained. For the best energy distribution model, none of the redshift
distributions we considered are rejected by the data. A future, larger, uniform
FRB sample (such as the one collected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment, CHIME) can provide better constraints on the intrinsic FRB
redshift distribution using the methodology presented in this paper.

Dedicated surveys using different detection pipelines are being carried out
at multiple observatories to find more Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Understanding
the efficiency of detection algorithms and the survey completeness function is
important to enable unbiased estimation of the underlying FRB population
properties. One method to achieve end-to-end testing of the system is by
injecting mock FRBs in the live data-stream and searching for them blindly.
Mock FRB injection is particularly effective for machine-learning-based
classifiers, for which analytic characterisation is impractical. We describe a
first-of-its-kind implementation of a real-time mock FRB injection system at
the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) and present our
results for a set of 20,000 mock FRB injections. The injections have yielded
clear insight into the detection efficiencies and have provided a survey
completeness function for pulse width, fluence and DM. Mock FRBs are recovered
with uniform efficiency over the full range of injected DMs, however the
recovery fraction is found to be a strong function of the width and
Signal-to-Noise (SNR). For low widths ($\lesssim 20$ ms) and high SNR
($\gtrsim$ 9) the recovery is highly effective with recovery fractions
exceeding 90%. We find that the presence of radio frequency interference causes
the recovered SNR values to be systematically lower by up to 20% compared to
the injected values. We find that wider FRBs become increasingly hard to
recover for the machine-learning-based classifier employed at UTMOST. We
encourage other observatories to implement live injection set-ups for similar
testing of their surveys.

The recent discovery of a Mega-Jansky radio burst occurring simultaneously
with short X-ray bursts from the Galactic magnetar (strongly magnetized neutron
star (NS)) SGR 1935+2154 is a smoking gun for the hypothesis that some
cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs) arise from magnetar bursts. We argue that
the X-ray bursts with high temperature $T \gtrsim 30$ keV entail an
electron--positron ($e^{\pm}$) outflow from a trapped--expanding fireball,
polluting the NS magnetosphere before the FRB emission. The $e^{\pm}$ outflow
is opaque to FRB photons, and is strongly Compton-dragged by the X-ray bursts.
Nevertheless, the FRB photons can break out of the $e^{\pm}$ outflow with
radiation forces if the FRB emission radius is larger than a few tens of NS
radii. A FRB is choked if the FRB is weaker or the X-ray bursts are stronger,
possibly explaining why there are no FRBs with giant flares and no detectable
X-ray bursts with weak FRBs. We also speculate that the $e^{\pm}$ outflow may
be inevitable for FRBs, solving the problem of why the FRBs occur only with
high-$T$ X-ray bursts. The breakout physics is important for constraining the
emission mechanism and electromagnetic counterparts to future FRBs.

The spectra of fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode valuable information about the
source's local environment, underlying emission mechanism(s), and the
intervening media along the line of sight. We present results from a long-term
multiwavelength radio monitoring campaign of two repeating FRB sources, FRB
121102 and FRB 180916.J0158+65, with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) 70-m
radio telescopes (DSS-63 and DSS-14). The observations of FRB 121102 were
performed simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz, and spanned a total of 27.3 hr
between 2019 September 19 and 2020 February 11. We detected 2 radio bursts in
the 2.3 GHz frequency band from FRB 121102, but no evidence of radio emission
was found at 8.4 GHz during any of our observations. We observed FRB
180916.J0158+65 simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz, and also separately in the
1.5 GHz frequency band, for a total of 101.8 hr between 2019 September 19 and
2020 May 14. Our observations of FRB 180916.J0158+65 spanned multiple activity
cycles during which the source was known to be active and covered a wide range
of activity phases. Several of our observations occurred during times when
bursts were detected from the source between 400-800 MHz with the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope. However, no
radio bursts were detected from FRB 180916.J0158+65 at any of the frequencies
used during our observations with the DSN radio telescopes. We find that FRB
180916.J0158+65's apparent activity is strongly frequency-dependent due to the
narrowband nature of its radio bursts, which have less spectral occupancy at
high radio frequencies ($\gtrsim$ 2 GHz). We also find that fewer or fainter
bursts are emitted from the source at high radio frequencies. We discuss the
implications of these results on possible progenitor models of repeating FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08519v1
We investigate the dispersion measure(DM) and scattering of FRBs by the
intergalactic-medium(IGM), foreground and host halos, using cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation. We find that the median DM caused by foreground
halos is around 30\% of that caused by the IGM, but has a much larger variance.
The DM induced by hosts deviates from a log-normal distribution, but exhibits
an extended distribution in the range of $1-3000 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$ with a
median value $\sim 100 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$. Then we produce mock FRB
sources, assuming a uniform distribution in the range $z\sim 0-0.82$, to
consider the propagation effect of IGM, foreground and host halos on FRB
signals simultaneously. The DM distribution of mock sources agrees well with
the observation. The fitted DM-redshift relation of the mock sources can
provide a rough estimation of the redshifts of observed events with errors
$\delta z \lesssim 0.15$. The distribution of mock sources in the DM-scattering
time($\tau$) space can also match the observation, assuming a Kolmogorov
turbulence model with the inner and outer scale is 1000 km to 1 AU, and 0.2-10
pc respectively. Finally, we estimate the relative importance of these medium
on DM and $\tau$ in our models. The IGM and host halos are the primary and
secondary sources to the extragalactic DM, $\rm{DM_{exg}}$. Meanwhile, the
contribution from foreground halos increases as $\rm{DM_{exg}}$ increases. The
host and foreground halos may be the most important medium for scattering.
Statistically, the latter may dominate the scattering of events with
$\rm{DM_{exg}} \gtrsim 200 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$.

We present deep Apache Point Observatory optical observations within seconds
of the outburst of the periodic fast radio burst (FRB) 180916.J0158+65 obtained
on 3 September 2020. FRB 180916.J0158+65 is located in a nearby spiral galaxy
150 Mpc away and has an "active phase" with a well-measured period of
approximately 16.3 days. Targeting the FRB at the peak of its expected active
phase and during a recent 30 minute observing window by the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), we did not detect any transient optical
emission at m_i=24.7~mag (3-sigma) from 2.2 to 1938.1 seconds after the burst
arrival time in optical bands (corrected for dispersion). Comparing our
limiting magnitudes to models of a synchrotron maser formed in the circumburst
environment of FRB 180916+J0158.65, we constrain scenarios where the burst
energy was >1e44 erg and the circumburst density was >1e4 cm-3.

The discovery that the Galactic SGR 1935$+$2154 emitted FRB 200428
simultaneous with a gamma-ray flare demonstrated the common source and
association of these phenomena. If FRB radio emission is the result of coherent
curvature radiation, the net charge of the radiating "bunches" or waves may be
inferred from the radiated fields, independent of the mechanism by which the
bunches are produced. A statistical argument indicates that the radiating
bunches must have a Lorentz factor $\gtrapprox 10$. The observed radiation
frequencies indicate that their phase velocity (pattern speed) corresponds to
Lorentz factors $\gtrapprox 100$. Coulomb repulsion implies that the electrons
making up these bunches may have yet larger Lorentz factors, limited by their
incoherent curvature radiation. These electrons also Compton scatter the soft
gamma-rays of the SGR. In FRB 200428 the power radiated coherently at radio
frequencies exceeded that of Compton scattering, but in more luminous SGR
outbursts Compton scattering dominates, precluding the acceleration of
energetic electrons. This explains the absence of a FRB associated with the
giant 27 December 2004 outburst of SGR 1806$-$20. SGR with luminosity $\gtrsim
10^{42}$ ergs/s do not emit FRB, while those of lesser luminosity can do so.
"Superbursts" like FRB 200428 are produced when narrowly collimated FRB are
aligned with the line of sight; they are unusual, but not rare, and
"cosmological" FRB may be superbursts.

We report on simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of the radio-emitting
magnetar 1E1547.0-5408 on 2009 January 25 and February 3, with the 64-m Parkes
radio telescope and the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. The
magnetar was observed in a period of intense X-ray bursting activity and
enhanced X-ray emission. We report here on the detection of two radio bursts
from 1E1547.0-5408, reminiscent of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). One of the radio
bursts was anticipated by ~1s (about half a rotation period of the pulsar) by a
bright SGR-like X-ray burst, resulting in a F_radio/F_X ~ 10^-9. Radio
pulsations were not detected during the observation showing the FRB-like radio
bursts, while they were detected in the previous radio observation. We also
found that the two radio bursts are neither aligned with the latter radio
pulsations nor with the peak of the X-ray pulse profile (phase shift of ~0.2).
Comparing the luminosity of these FRB-like bursts and those reported from
SGR1935+2154, we find that the wide range in radio efficiency and/or luminosity
of magnetar bursts in the Galaxy may bridge the gap between "ordinary" pulsar
radio bursts and the extragalactic FRB phenomenon.

We propose a geometrical explanation for periodically and nonperiodically
repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) under neutron star (NS)-companion systems.
We suggest a constant critical binary separation, $r_{\rm c}$, within which the
interaction between the NS and companion can trigger FRB bursts. For an
elliptic orbit with the minimum and maximum binary separations, $r_{\rm min}$
and $r_{\rm max}$, a periodically repeating FRB with an active period could be
reproduced if $r_{\rm min}<r_{\rm c}<r_{\rm max}$. However, if $r_{\rm
max}<r_{\rm c}$, the modulation of orbital motion will not work due to
persistent interaction, and this kind of repeating FRBs should be nonperiodic.
We test relevant NS-companion binary scenarios on the basis of FRB
180916.J0158+65 and FRB 121102 under this geometrical frame. It is found that
the pulsar-asteroid belt impact model is more suitable to explain these two
FRBs since this model is compatible with different companions (e.g., massive
stars and black holes). At last, we point out that FRB 121102-like samples are
potential objects which can reveal the evolution of star-forming region.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a mysterious astrophysical phenomenon of bright
pulses emitted at radio frequencies, and they are expected to be frequently
detected in the future. The dispersion measures of FRBs are related to
cosmological parameters, thus FRBs have the potential to be developed into a
new cosmological probe if their data can be largely accumulated in the future.
In this work, we study the capability of future FRB data to improve
cosmological parameter estimation in two dynamical dark energy models. We find
that the simulated FRB data can break the parameter degeneracies inherent in
the current cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Therefore, the combination
of the CMB and FRB data can significantly improve the constraints on the Hubble
constant and dark energy parameters, compared to those using CMB or FRB alone.
If 10,000 FRB events with known redshifts are detected in the future, they
would perform better than the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in
breaking the parameter degeneracies inherent in the CMB data. We also find that
the combination of FRB and gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren data provides
an independent low-redshift probe to verify the results from the CMB and BAO
data. For the data combination of CMB, GW, and FRB, it is found that the main
contribution to the constraints comes from the CMB and GW data, but the
inclusion of the FRB data still can evidently improve the constraint on the
baryon density.

A formula is proposed to quantitatively estimate the signal emission rate of
Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent civilizations (CETIs) in the
Galaxy. I suggest that one possible type of CETI signal would be brief radio
bursts similar to fast radio bursts (FRBs). A dedicated search for FRB-like
artificial signals in the Galaxy for decades may pose a meaningful upper limit
on the emission rate of these signals by CETIs. The Fermi-Hart paradox is
answered in terms of not having enough observing times for this and other types
of signals. Whether humans should send FRB-like signals in the far future is
briefly discussed.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients
of unknown origin observed at extragalactic distances. It has been long
speculated that magnetars are the engine powering repeating bursts from FRB
sources, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far\cite{sun19}.
Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active phase by
emitting intense soft Gamma-ray bursts. One FRB-like event with two peaks (FRB
200428) and a luminosity slightly lower than the faintest extragalactic FRBs
was detected from the source, in association with a soft Gamma-ray / hard X-ray
flare. Here we report an eight-hour targeted radio observational campaign
comprising four sessions and assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard
X-rays) data. During the third session, 29 soft Gamma-ray repeater (SGR) bursts
were detected in Gamma-ray energies. Throughout the observing period, we
detected no single dispersed pulsed emission coincident with the arrivals of
SGR bursts, but unfortunately we were not observing when the FRB was detected.
The non-detection places a fluence upper limit that is eight orders of
magnitude lower than the fluence of FRB 200428. Our results suggest that FRB --
SGR burst associations are rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and
geometrically beamed, or FRB-like events associated with SGR bursts may have
narrow spectra and characteristic frequencies outside the observed band. It is
also possible that the physical conditions required to achieve coherent
radiation in SGR bursts are difficult to satisfy, and that only under extreme
conditions could an FRB be associated with an SGR burst.

Reflections from objects in Earth orbit can produce sub-second, star-like
optical flashes similar to astrophysical transients. Reflections have
historically caused false alarms for transient surveys, but the population has
not been systematically studied. We report event rates for these orbital
flashes using the Evryscope Fast Transient Engine, a low-latency transient
detection pipeline for the Evryscopes. We select single-epoch detections likely
caused by Earth satellites and model the event rate as a function of both
magnitude and sky position. We measure a rate of $1800^{+600}_{-280}$
sky$^{-1}$ hour$^{-1}$, peaking at $m_g = 13.0$, for flashes morphologically
degenerate with real astrophysical signals in surveys like the Evryscopes. Of
these, $340^{+150}_{-85}$ sky$^{-1}$ hour$^{-1}$ are bright enough to be
visible to the naked eye in typical suburban skies with a visual limiting
magnitude of $V\approx4$. These measurements place the event rate of orbital
flashes orders of magnitude higher than the combined rate of public alerts from
all active all-sky fast-timescale transient searches, including neutrino,
gravitational-wave, gamma-ray, and radio observatories. Short-timescale orbital
flashes form a dominating foreground for un-triggered searches for fast
transients in low-resolution, wide-angle surveys. However, events like fast
radio bursts (FRBs) with arcminute-scale localization have a low probability
($\sim10^{-5}$) of coincidence with an orbital flash, allowing optical surveys
to place constraints on their potential optical counterparts in single images.
Upcoming satellite internet constellations, like SpaceX Starlink, are unlikely
to contribute significantly to the population of orbital flashes in normal
operations.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are the short, strong radio pulses lasting several
milliseconds. They are subsequently identified, for the most part, as emanating
from unknown objects at cosmological distances. At present, over one hundred
FRBs have been verified, classified into two groups: repeating bursts (20
samples) and apparently non-repeating bursts (91 samples). Their origins,
however, are still hotly debated. Here,we investigate the statistical
classifications for the two groups of samples to see if the non-repeating and
repeating FRBs have different origins by employing Anderson-Darling (A-D) test
and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (M-W-W) test. Firstly, by taking the pulse width as a
statistical variant, we found that the repeating samples do not follow the
Gaussian statistics (may belong to a chi-square distribution), although the
overall data and non-repeating group do follow the Gaussian. Meanwhile, to
investigate the statistical differences between the two groups, we turn to
M-W-W test and notice that the two distributions have different origins.
Secondly, we consider the FRB radio luminosity as a statistical variant, and
find that both groups of samples can be regarded as the Gaussian distributions
under the A-D test, although they have different origins according to M-W-W
tests. Therefore, statistically, we can conclude that our classifications of
both repeaters and non-repeaters are plausible, that the two FRB classes have
different origins, or each has experienced distinctive phases or been subject
to its own physical processes.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of unknown
origin. Two possible mechanisms that could generate extremely coherent emission
from FRBs invoke neutron star magnetospheres or relativistic shocks far from
the central energy source. Detailed polarization observations may help us to
understand the emission mechanism. However, the available FRB polarization data
have been perplexing, because they show a host of polarimetric properties,
including either a constant polarization angle during each burst for some
repeaters or variable polarization angles in some other apparently one-off
events. Here we report observations of 15 bursts from FRB 180301 and find
various polarization angle swings in seven of them. The diversity of the
polarization angle features of these bursts is consistent with a magnetospheric
origin of the radio emission, and disfavours the radiation models invoking
relativistic shocks.

Instabilities in a neutron star can generate Alfv\'en waves in its
magnetosphere. Propagation along the curved magnetic field lines strongly
shears the wave, boosting its electric current $j_{\rm A}$. We derive an
analytic expression for the evolution of the wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}$ and
the growth of $j_{\rm A}$. In the strongly sheared regime, $j_{\rm A}$ may
exceed the maximum current $j_{0}$ that can be supported by the background
$e^{\pm}$ plasma. We investigate these "charge-starved" waves, first using a
simplified two-fluid analytic model, then with first-principles kinetic
simulations. We find that the Alfv\'en wave continues to propagate successfully
even when $\kappa \equiv j_{\rm A}/j_{0} \gg 1$. It sustains $j_{\rm A}$ by
compressing and advecting the plasma along the magnetic field lines with
particle Lorentz factors $\sim \kappa^{1/2}$. The simulations show how plasma
instabilities lead to gradual dissipation of the wave energy, giving a
dissipation power $L_{\rm diss}\sim 10^{35}(\kappa/100)^{1/2}
(B_w/10^{11}\,{\rm G})\,\mathrm{erg/s}$, where $B_w$ is the wave amplitude. Our
results imply that dissipation due to charge starvation is not sufficient to
power observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), in contrast to recent proposals.

Quasi-periodic oscillations inferred during rare magnetar giant flare tails
were initially interpreted as torsional oscillations of the neutron star (NS)
crust, and have been more recently described as global core+crust
perturbations. Similar frequencies are also present in high signal-to-noise
magnetar short bursts. In magnetars, disturbances of the field are strongly
coupled to the NS crust regardless of the triggering mechanism of short bursts.
For low-altitude magnetospheric magnetar models of fast radio bursts (FRBs)
associated with magnetar short bursts, such as the low-twist model, crustal
oscillations may be associated with additional radio bursts in the encompassing
short burst event (as recently suggested for SGR 1935+2154). Given the large
extragalactic volume probed by wide-field radio transient facilities, this
offers the prospect of studying NS crusts leveraging samples far more numerous
than galactic high-energy magnetar bursts by studying statistics of sub-burst
structure or clustered trains of FRBs. We explore the prospects for
distinguishing NS equation of state models with increasingly larger future sets
of FRB observations. Lower $l$-number eigenmodes (corresponding to FRB time
intervals of $\sim5-50$ ms) are likely less susceptible than high-$l$ modes to
confusion by systematic effects associated with the NS crust physics, magnetic
field, and damping. They may be more promising in their utility, and also may
corroborate models where FRBs arise from mature magnetars. Future observational
characterization of such signals can also determine whether they can be
employed as cosmological "standard oscillators" to constrain redshift, or can
be used to constrain the mass of FRB-producing magnetars when reliable
redshifts are available.

Fast radio burst (FRB) discoveries are occurring rapidly, with thousands
expected from upcoming surveys. The dispersion measures (DM) observed for FRB
include important information on cosmological distances and the ionization
state of the universe from the redshift of emission until today. Rather than
considering the DM--redshift relation, we investigate the statistical ensemble
of the distribution of dispersion measures. We explore the use of this
abundance information, with and without redshift information, to probe helium
reionization. Carrying out Monte Carlo simulations of FRB survey samples, we
examine the effect of different source redshift distributions, host galaxy
models, sudden vs gradual reionization, and covariance with cosmological
parameters on determination of helium reionization properties. We find that a
fluence limited survey with 10$^4$ FRBs can discriminate different helium
reionization histories at $\sim6\sigma$ using the DM-distribution of bursts,
without redshift information (and $\sim10\sigma$ with redshifts).
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14379v1
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a new kind of extragalactic radio transients.
Some of them show repeating behaviors. Recent observations indicate that a few
repeating FRBs (e.g., FRB 121102) present time--frequency downward drifting
patterns and nearly 100$\%$ linear polarization. Following the model of
\citet{dai 2016} who proposed that repeating FRBs may originate from a
slowly-rotating, old-aged pulsar colliding with an asteroid belt around a
stellar-mass object, we focus on the prediction of time--frequency drifting and
polarization. In this scenario, the frequency drifting is mainly caused by the
geometric structure of a pulsar magnetosphere, and the drifting rate--frequency
index is found to be $25/17$. On the other hand, by considering the typical
differential mass distribution of incident asteroids, we find that an asteroid
with mass $m\gtrsim 10^{17}~{\rm g}$ colliding with the pulsar would contribute
abundant gravitational energy, which powers an FRB. A broad frequency band of
the FRBs would be expected, due to the mass difference of the incident
asteroids. In addition, we simulate the linear polarization distribution for
the repeating FRBs, and constrain the linear polarization with $\gtrsim$ 30$\%$
for the FRBs with flux of an order of magnitude lower than the maximum flux.

The association of FRB 200428 with an X-ray burst (XRB) from the Galactic
magnetar SGR 1935+2154 offers important implications for the physical processes
responsible for the fast radio burst (FRB) phenomena. By assuming that the XRB
emission is produced in the magnetosphere, we investigate the possibility that
the FRB emission is produced by shock-powered synchrotron maser (SM), which is
phenomenologically described with a plenty of free parameters. The
observational constraints on the model parameters indicate that the model can
in principle be consistent with the FRB 200428 observations, if the ejecta
lunched by magnetar activities can have appropriate ingredients and structures
and the shock processes occur on the line of sight. To be specific, a complete
burst ejecta should consist of an ultra-relativistic and extremely highly
collimated $e^{\pm}$ component and a sub-relativistic and wide-spreading
baryonic component. The internal shocks producing the FRB emission arise from a
collision between the $e^{\pm}$ ejecta and the remnant of a previous baryonic
ejecta at the same direction. The parameter constraints are still dependent on
the uncertain spectrum and efficiency of the SM emission. While the spectrum is
tentatively described by a spectral index of $-2$, we estimate the emission
efficiency to be around $10^{-4}$ by requiring that the synchrotron emission of
the shocked material cannot be much brighter than the magnetosphere XRB
emission.

The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) still remains a mystery, even with the
increased number of discoveries in the last three years. Growing evidence
suggests that some FRBs may originate from magnetars. Large, single-dish
telescopes such as Arecibo Observatory (AO) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) have
the sensitivity to detect FRB~121102-like bursts at gigaparsec distances. Here
we present searches using AO and GBT that aimed to find potential radio bursts
at 11 sites of past $\gamma$--ray bursts that show evidence for the birth of a
magnetar. We also performed a search towards GW170817, which has a merger
remnant whose nature remains uncertain. We place $10\,\sigma$ fluence upper
limits of $\approx 0.036$ Jy ms at 1.4 GHz and $\approx 0.063$ Jy ms at 4.5 GHz
for AO data and fluence upper limits of $\approx 0.085$ Jy ms at 1.4 GHz and
$\approx 0.098$ Jy ms at 1.9 GHz for GBT data, for a maximum pulse width of
$\approx 42$ ms. The AO observations had sufficient sensitivity to detect any
FRB of similar luminosity to the one recently detected from the Galactic
magnetar SGR 1935+2154. Assuming a Schechter function for the luminosity
function of FRBs, we find that our non-detections favor a steep power--law
index ($\alpha\lesssim-1.0$) and a large cut--off luminosity ($L_0 \gtrsim
10^{42}$ erg/s).

We provide an empirical list of the Galactic dispersion measure ($DM_{Gal}$)
contribution to the extragalactic fast radio bursts along 72 sightlines. It is
independent of any model of the Galaxy, i.e., we do not assume the density of
the disk or the halo, spatial extent of the halo, baryonic mass content, or any
such external constraints to measure $DM_{Gal}$. We use 21-cm, UV, EUV and
X-ray data to account for different phases, and find that $DM_{Gal}$ is
dominated by the hot phase probed by X-ray absorption. We improve upon the
measurements of N(\oviin) and f$_{OVII}$ compared to previous studies, thus
providing a better estimate of the hot phase contribution. The median
$DM_{Gal}$=64$^{+20}_{-23}$ cm$^{-3}$ pc, with a 68\% (90\%) confidence
interval of 33--172 (23--660) cm$^{-3}$ pc. The $DM_{Gal}$ does not appear to
follow any trend with the galactic longitude or latitude, and there is a large
scatter around the values predicted by simple disk+spherical halo models. Our
measurements provide more complete and accurate estimates of $DM_{Gal}$
independent from the previous studies. We provide a table and a code to
retrieve $DM_{Gal}$ for any FRB localized in the sky.

Star quakes and internal phase transitions within anomalous x-ray pulsars
(AXPs) and soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters (SGRs) can produce mini contractions and
pulsar glitches. Shocks break out from their surface following such
contractions produce thermal x/$\gamma$-ray bursts. Highly relativistic dipolar
$e^+e^-$ bunches launched from the pulsar polar caps emit fast radio bursts
(FRBs) of narrowly beamed coherent curvature radiation, visible if they point
in the direction of Earth. Although these surface x/$\gamma$-ray bursts are
isotropic and are many orders of magnitude more energetic than the FRBs, they
are detectable by the current all sky x-ray and $\gamma$-ray monitors only from
our galaxy and very nearby galaxies.

Detections from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 are clustered in
time, noticeable even in the earliest repeat bursts. Recently, it was argued
that the source activity is periodic, suggesting that the clustering reflected
a not-yet-identified periodicity. We performed an extensive multi-wavelength
campaign with the Effelsberg telescope, the Green Bank telescope and the
Arecibo Observatory to shadow the Gran Telescope Canaria (optical), NuSTAR
(X-ray) and INTEGRAL (gamma-ray). We detected 36 bursts with Effelsberg, one
with a pulse width of 39\,ms, the widest burst ever detected from FRB 121102.
With one burst detected during simultaneous NuSTAR observations, we place a
5-$\sigma$ upper limit of $5\times10^{47}$ erg on the 3--79\,keV energy of an
X-ray burst counterpart. We tested the periodicity hypothesis using 165-hr of
Effelsberg observations and find a periodicity of 161$\pm$5 days. We predict
the source to be active from 2020-07-09 to 2020-10-14 and subsequently from
2020-12-17 to 2021-03-24. We compare the wait times between consecutive bursts
within a single observation to Weibull and Poisson distributions. We conclude
that the strong clustering was indeed a consequence of a periodic activity and
show that if the few events with millisecond separation are excluded, the
arrival times are Poisson distributed. We model the bursts' cumulative energy
distribution with energies from ${\sim}10^{38}$-$10^{39}$ erg and find that it
is well described by a power-law with slope of $\gamma=-1.1\pm 0.2$. We propose
that a single power-law might be a poor descriptor of the data over many orders
of magnitude.

We discuss observational strategies to detect prompt bursts associated with
gravitational wave events using the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP). Many theoretical models of binary neutron stars mergers
predict that bright, prompt radio emission would accompany the merger. The
detection of such prompt emission would greatly improve our knowledge of the
physical conditions, environment, and location of the merger. However, searches
for prompt emission are complicated by the relatively poor localisation for
gravitational wave events, with the 90\% credible region reaching hundreds or
even thousands of square degrees. Operating in fly's eye mode, the ASKAP field
of view can reach $\sim$1000 deg$^2$ at $\sim 888\,{\rm MHz}$. This potentially
allows observers to cover most of the 90\% credible region quickly enough to
detect prompt emission. We use skymaps for GW170817 and GW190814 from
LIGO/Virgo's third observing run to simulate the probability of detecting
prompt emission for gravitational wave events in the upcoming fourth observing
run. With only alerts released after merger we find it difficult to slew the
telescope sufficiently quickly as to capture any prompt emission. However, with
the addition of alerts released \textit{before} merger by negative-latency
pipelines we find that it should be possible to search for nearby, bright
prompt FRB-like emission from gravitational wave events. Nonetheless, the rates
are low: we would expect to observe $\sim$0.012 events during the fourth
observing run, assuming that the prompt emission is emitted microseconds around
the merger
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08282v1
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extreme astrophysical phenomena entering the
realm of non-linear optics, a field developed in laser physics. A classical
non-linear effect is self-modulation. We examine the propagation of FRBs
through the circumburst environment using the idealised setup of a
monochromatic linearly-polarised GHz wave propagating through a uniform plasma
slab of density $N$ at distance $R$ from the source. We find that
self-modulation occurs if the slab is located within a critical radius $R_{\rm
crit}\sim 10^{17}(N/10^2{\rm\; cm}^{-3})(L/10^{42}{\rm\; erg\; s}^{-1}){\rm\;
cm}$, where $L$ is the isotropic equivalent of the FRB luminosity.
Self-modulation breaks the burst into pancakes transverse to the radial
direction. When $R\lesssim R_{\rm crit}$, the transverse size of the pancakes
is smaller than the Fresnel scale. The pancakes are strongly diffracted as the
burst exits the slab, and interference between the pancakes produces a
frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a sub-GHz bandwidth. When
$R\sim R_{\rm crit}$, the transverse size of the pancakes becomes comparable
with the Fresnel scale, and the effect of diffraction is weaker. The observed
intensity is modulated on a timescale of ten microseconds, which corresponds to
the radial width of the pancakes. Our results suggest that self-modulation may
cause the temporal and frequency structure observed in FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07796v1
The light curve of the fast radio burst (FRB) 181112 is resolved into four
successive pulses, and the time interval ($\sim0.8$ ms) between the first and
third pulses coincides with that between the second and fourth pulses, which
can be interpreted as a neutron star (NS) spinning at a period of about $0.8$
ms. Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar
currently known ($1.4$ ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed
immediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a
BNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is
real. We discuss the future implications that can be obtained if such a
periodicity is detected from FRBs simultaneously with gravitational waves (GW).
The remnant spin period $P_{\rm rem}$ inferred from the FRB observation is
unique information which is not readily obtained by current GW observations at
the post-merger phase. If combined with the mass of the merger remnant $M_{\rm
rem}$ inferred from GW data, it would set a new constraint on the equation of
state of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the post-merger quantity $P_{\rm
rem}/M_{\rm rem}$, or the tidal deformability of the merger remnant, is closely
related to the binary tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$ of NSs before
they merge, and a joint FRB-GW observation will establish a new limit on
$\Lambda$. Thus, if $\Lambda$ is also well measured by GW data, a comparison
between these two will provide further insights into the nature of nuclear
matter and BNS mergers.

We present observations and detailed characterizations of five new host
galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered with the Australian Square
Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and localized to $\lesssim 1''$. Combining
these galaxies with FRB hosts from the literature, we introduce criteria based
on the probability of chance coincidence to define a sub-sample of 10
highly-confident associations (at $z=0.03-0.52$), three of which correspond to
known repeating FRBs. Overall, the FRB host galaxies exhibit a broad,
continuous range of color ($M_u-M_r = 0.9 - 2.0$), stellar mass ($M_\star =
10^{8} - 6\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$), and star-formation rate (${\rm SFR} =
0.05 - 10\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) spanning the full parameter space
occupied by $z<0.5$ galaxies. However, they do not track the color-magnitude,
SFR-$M_\star$, nor BPT diagrams of field galaxies surveyed at similar
redshifts. There is an excess of "green valley" galaxies and an excess of
emission-line ratios indicative of a harder radiation field than that generated
by star-formation alone. From the observed stellar mass distribution, we rule
out the hypothesis that FRBs strictly track stellar mass in galaxies ($>99\%$
c.l.). We measure a median offset of 3.3 kpc from the FRB to the estimated
center of the host galaxies and compare the host-burst offset distribution and
other properties with the distributions of long- and short-duration gamma-ray
bursts (LGRBs and SGRBs), core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe), and Type Ia SNe.
This analysis rules out galaxies hosting LGRBs (faint, star-forming galaxies)
as common hosts for FRBs ($>95\%$ c.l.). Other transient channels (SGRBs, CC-
and Type Ia SNe) have host galaxy properties and offsets consistent with the
FRB distributions. All of the data and derived quantities are made publicly
available on a dedicated website and repository.

We present a new fast radio burst (FRB) at 920 MHz discovered during
commensal observations conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP) as part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients
(CRAFT) survey. FRB 191001 was detected at a dispersion measure (DM) of
506.92(4) pc cm$^{-3}$ and its measured fluence of 143(15) Jy ms is the highest
of the bursts localized to host galaxies by ASKAP to date. The subarcsecond
localization of the FRB provided by ASKAP reveals that the burst originated in
the outskirts of a highly star-forming spiral in a galaxy pair at redshift
$z=0.2340(1)$. Radio observations show no evidence for a compact persistent
radio source associated with the FRB 191001 above a flux density of $15 \mu$Jy.
However, we detect diffuse synchrotron radio emission from the disk of the host
galaxy that we ascribe to ongoing star formation. FRB 191001 was also detected
as an image-plane transient in a single 10 s snapshot with a flux density of
19.3 mJy in the low-time-resolution visibilities obtained simultaneously with
CRAFT data. The commensal observation facilitated a search for repeating and
slowly varying radio emissions 8 hr before and 1 hr after the burst. We found
no variable radio emission on timescales ranging from 1 ms to 1.4 hr. We report
our upper limits and briefly review FRB progenitor theories in the literature
that predict radio afterglows. Our data are still only weakly constraining of
any afterglows at the redshift of the FRB. Future commensal observations of
more nearby and bright FRBs will potentially provide stronger constraints.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, bright radio signals
(fluence $\mathrm{0.1 - 100\,Jy\,ms}$) emitted from extragalactic sources of
unknown physical origin. The recent CHIME/FRB and STARE2 detection of an
extremely bright (fluence $\sim$MJy$\,$ms) radio burst from the Galactic
magnetar SGR~1935$+$2154 supports the hypothesis that (at least some) FRBs are
emitted by magnetars at cosmological distances. In follow-up observations
totalling 522.7$\,$hrs on source, we detect two bright radio bursts with
fluences of $112\pm22\mathrm{\,Jy\,ms}$ and $24\pm5\mathrm{\,Jy\,ms}$,
respectively. Both bursts appear affected by interstellar scattering and we
measure significant linear and circular polarisation for the fainter burst. The
bursts are separated in time by $\sim$1.4$\,$s, suggesting a non-Poissonian,
clustered emission process -- similar to what has been seen in some repeating
FRBs. Together with the burst reported by CHIME/FRB and STARE2, as well as a
much fainter burst seen by FAST (fluence 60$\mathrm{\,mJy\,ms}$), our
observations demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 can produce bursts with apparent
energies spanning roughly seven orders of magnitude, and that the burst rate is
comparable across this range. This raises the question of whether these four
bursts arise from similar physical processes, and whether the FRB population
distribution extends to very low energies ($\sim10^{30}\,$erg, isotropic
equivalent).

We present temporal and time-integrated spectral analyses of 148 bursts from
the latest activation of SGR J1935+2154, observed with Fermi/GBM from October
4th 2019 through May 20th 2020, excluding a ~130 s segment with a very high
burst density on April 27th 2020. The 148 bursts presented here, are slightly
longer and softer than bursts from earlier activations of SGR J1935+2154, as
well as from other magnetars. The long-term spectral evolution trend is
interpreted as being associated with an increase in the average plasma loading
of the magnetosphere during bursts. We also find a trend of increased burst
activity from SGR J1935+2154 since its discovery in 2014. Finally, we find no
association of typical radio bursts with X-ray bursts from the source; this
contrasts the association of FRB 200428 with an SGR J1935+2154 X-ray burst, to
date unique among the magnetar population.

The spectra of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are complex and
time-variable, sometimes peaking within the observing band and showing a
fractional emission bandwidth of about 10-30%. These spectral features may
provide insight into the emission mechanism of repeating fast radio bursts, or
they could possibly be explained by extrinsic propagation effects in the local
environment. Broadband observations can better quantify this behavior and help
to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects. We present results from
a simultaneous 2.25 and 8.36 GHz observation of the repeating FRB 121102 using
the 70 m Deep Space Network (DSN) radio telescope, DSS-43. During the 5.7 hr
continuous observing session, we detected 6 bursts from FRB 121102, which were
visible in the 2.25 GHz frequency band. However, none of these bursts were
detected in the 8.36 GHz band, despite the larger bandwidth and greater
sensitivity in the higher-frequency band. This effect is not explainable by
Galactic scintillation and, along with previous multi-band experiments, clearly
demonstrates that apparent burst activity depends strongly on the radio
frequency band that is being observed.

Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) have been
proposed as progenitors of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). In this
scenario, bursts originate from the interaction between a young magnetar and
its surrounding supernova remnant (SNR). Such a model could explain the
repeating, apparently non-Poissonian nature of FRB121102, which appears to
display quiescent and active phases. This bursting behaviour is better
explained with a Weibull distribution, which includes parametrisation for
clustering. We observed 10 SLSNe/LGRBs for 63 hours, looking for repeating FRBs
with the Effelsberg-100 m radio telescope, but have not detected any bursts. We
scale the burst rate of FRB121102 to an FRB121102-like source inhabiting each
of our observed targets, and compare this rate to our upper burst rate limit on
a source by source basis. By adopting a fiducial beaming fraction of 0.6, we
obtain 99.99\% and 83.4\% probabilities that at least one, and at least half of
our observed sources are beamed towards us respectively. One of our SLSN
targets, PTF10hgi, is coincident with a persistent radio source, making it a
possible analogue to FRB121102. We performed further observations on this
source using the Effelsberg-100~m and Parkes-64~m radio telescopes. Assuming
that PTF10hgi contains an FRB121102-like source, the probabilities of not
detecting any bursts from a Weibull distribution during our observations are
14\% and 16\% for Effelsberg and Parkes respectively. We conclude by showing
that a survey of many short observations increases burst detection probability
for a source with Weibull distributed bursting activity.

With the localization of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to galaxies similar to the
Milky Way and the detection of a bright radio burst from SGR J1935+2154 with
energy comparable to extragalactic radio bursts, a magnetar origin for FRBs is
evident. By studying the environments of FRBs, evidence for magnetar formation
mechanisms not observed in the Milky Way may become apparent. In this paper, we
use a sample of FRB host galaxies and a complete sample of core-collapse
supernova (CCSN) hosts to determine whether FRB progenitors are consistent with
a population of magnetars born in CCSNe. We also compare the FRB hosts to the
hosts of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and long gamma-ray
bursts (LGRBs) to determine whether the population of FRB hosts is compatible
with a population of transients that may be connected to millisecond magnetars.
After using a novel approach to scale the stellar masses and star-formation
rates of each host galaxy to be statistically representative of $z=0$ galaxies,
we find that the CCSN hosts and FRBs are consistent with arising from the same
distribution. Furthermore, the FRB host distribution is inconsistent with the
distribution of SLSNe-I and LGRB hosts. With the current sample of FRB host
galaxies, our analysis shows that FRBs are consistent with a population of
magnetars born through the collapse of giant, highly magnetic stars.

The nature of dark matter (DM) is still a mystery that may indicate the
necessity for extensions of the Standard Model (SM). Light dark photons (DP)
may comprise partially or entirely the observed DM density and existing limits
on the DP DM parameter space arise from several cosmological and astrophysical
sources. In the present work we investigate DP DM using cosmic transients,
specifically fast radio bursts (FRBs). The observed time delay of radio photons
with different energies have been used to constrain the photon mass or the Weak
Equivalence Principle, for example. Due to the mixing between the visible and
the DP, the time delay of photons from these cosmic transients, caused by free
electrons in the intergalactic medium, can change and impact those constraints
from FRBs. We use five detected FRBs and two associations of FRBs with
gamma-ray bursts to investigate the correspondent variation on the time delay
caused by the presence of DP DM. The result is virtually independent of the FRB
used and this variation is very small, considering the still allowed DP DM
parameter space, not jeopardizing current bounds on other contributions of the
observed time delay.

We report the detection of a bright fast radio burst, FRB\,191108, with
Apertif on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The interferometer
allows us to localise the FRB to a narrow $5\arcsec\times7\arcmin$ ellipse by
employing both multibeam information within the Apertif phased-array feed (PAF)
beam pattern, and across different tied-array beams. The resulting sight line
passes close to Local Group galaxy M33, with an impact parameter of only
18\,kpc with respect to the core. It also traverses the much larger
circumgalactic medium of M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. We find that the shared
plasma of the Local Group galaxies could contribute $\sim$10\% of its
dispersion measure of 588\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. FRB\,191108 has a Faraday rotation
measure of +474\,$\pm\,3$\,rad\,m$^{-2}$, which is too large to be explained by
either the Milky Way or the intergalactic medium. Based on the more moderate
RMs of other extragalactic sources that traverse the halo of M33, we conclude
that the dense magnetised plasma resides in the host galaxy. The FRB exhibits
frequency structure on two scales, one that is consistent with quenched
Galactic scintillation and broader spectral structure with
$\Delta\nu\approx40$\,MHz. If the latter is due to scattering in the shared
M33/M31 CGM, our results constrain the Local Group plasma environment. We found
no accompanying persistent radio sources in the Apertif imaging survey data.

Despite many searches for periodicity in the repeating fast radio burst FRB
121102, the underlying pattern of bursts does not appear to be a periodic one.
We report a logarithmic repetition pattern in FRB 121102 in the sense that the
rate falls off inversely with time for each set of bursts. This result implies
that repeating FRB sources are not necessarily associated with a pulsar, but
rather could be caused by a different type of phenomenon that involves an equal
amount of energy output per log time.

We demonstrate the blind interferometric detection and localization of two
fast radio bursts (FRBs) with 2- and 25-arcsecond precision on the 400-m
baseline between the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and
the CHIME Pathfinder. In the same spirit as very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI), the telescopes were synchronized to separate clocks, and the
channelized voltage (herein referred to as "baseband") data were saved to disk
with correlation performed offline. The simultaneous wide field of view and
high sensitivity required for blind FRB searches implies a high data rate --
6.5 terabits per second (Tb/s) for CHIME and 0.8 Tb/s for the Pathfinder. Since
such high data rates cannot be continuously saved, we buffer data from both
telescopes locally in memory for $\approx 40$ s, and write to disk upon receipt
of a low-latency trigger from the CHIME Fast Radio Burst Instrument
(CHIME/FRB). The $\approx200$ deg$^2$ field of view of the two telescopes
allows us to use in-field calibrators to synchronize the two telescopes without
needing either separate calibrator observations or an atomic timing standard.
In addition to our FRB observations, we analyze bright single pulses from the
pulsars B0329+54 and B0355+54 to characterize systematic localization errors.
Our results demonstrate the successful implementation of key software,
triggering, and calibration challenges for CHIME/FRB Outriggers: cylindrical
VLBI outrigger telescopes which, along with the CHIME telescope, will localize
thousands of single FRB events to 50 milliarcsecond precision.

We explore possible effects of a magnetar burst on the radio, X-ray, and
gamma-ray flux of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We assume that the burst injects
electron-positron pairs or powers the magnetic field and explore the total
energy at injection and the spectral index needed in order to increase the
X-ray flux by about one order of magnitude, as well as its decay time until
reaching quiescence. We also explore magnetically powered phenomenology that
could explain a temporary increase of the PWN synchrotron emitted flux and
perhaps the relatively common lack of PWNe surrounding magnetars. This
phenomenological study is of interest for fast radio bursts (FRBs) as well,
given that the connection between magnetars and this kind of systems have been
recently established observationally.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09621v2
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond transients of unknown origin(s)
occurring at cosmological distances. Here we, for the first time, show
time-integrated-luminosity functions and volumetric occurrence rates of
non-repeating and repeating FRBs against redshift. The
time-integrated-luminosity functions of non-repeating FRBs do not show any
significant redshift evolution. The volumetric occurrence rates are almost
constant during the past $\sim$10 Gyr. The nearly-constant rate is consistent
with a flat trend of cosmic stellar-mass density traced by old stellar
populations. Our findings indicate that the occurrence rate of non-repeating
FRBs follows the stellar-mass evolution of long-living objects with $\sim$Gyr
time scales, favouring e.g. white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, as
likely progenitors of non-repeating FRBs. In contrast, the occurrence rates of
repeating FRBs may increase towards higher redshifts in a similar way to the
cosmic star formation-rate density or black hole accretion-rate density if the
slope of their luminosity function does not evolve with redshift. Short-living
objects with $\lesssim$ Myr time scales associated with young stellar
populations (or their remnants, e.g., supernova remnants, young pulsars, and
magnetars) or active galactic nuclei might be favoured as progenitor candidates
of repeating FRBs.

Despite existing constraints, it remains possible that up to $35\%$ of all
dark matter is comprised of compact objects, such as the black holes in the
10-100\,M$_\odot$ range whose existence has been confirmed by LIGO. The strong
gravitational lensing of transients such as FRBs and GRBs has been suggested as
a more sensitive probe for compact dark matter than intensity fluctuations
observed in microlensing experiments. Recently ASKAP has reported burst
substructure down to $15\mu$s timescales in FRBs in the redshift range
$0.3-0.5$. We investigate here the implications of this for the detectability
of compact dark matter by FRBs. We find that a sample size of $\sim130$ FRBs
would be required to constrain compact dark matter to less than the existing
35$\%$ limit with 95$\%$ confidence, if it were distributed along $\gtrsim
1\,$Gpc-long FRB sightlines through the cosmic web. Conversely, existing
constraints on the fraction of compact dark matter permit as many as 1 in
$\approx 40$ of all $z \lesssim 0.4$ FRBs to exhibit micro-lensed burst
structure. Approximately $170$ FRBs intercepting halos within $\sim 50\,$kpc
would be required to exclude the fraction of compact dark matter in each
intercepted halo to a similar level. Furthermore, we consider the cumulative
effects of lensing of the FRB signal by a macroscopic dark matter distribution.
We conclude that lensing from a uniform distribution of compact objects is
likely not observable, but suggest that FRBs may set meaningful limits on
power-law distributions of dark matter.

We present an overview of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) based spatial
processing system created for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME). The design employs AMD S9300x2 GPUs and readily-available
commercial hardware in its processing nodes to provide a cost- and
power-efficient processing substrate. These nodes are supported by a
liquid-cooling system which allows continuous operation with modest power
consumption and in all but the most adverse conditions. Capable of continuously
correlating 2048 receiver-polarizations across 400\,MHz of bandwidth, the CHIME
X-engine constitutes the most powerful radio correlator currently in existence.
It receives $6.6$\,Tb/s of channelized data from CHIME's FPGA-based F-engine,
and the primary correlation task requires $8.39\times10^{14}$ complex
multiply-and-accumulate operations per second. The same system also provides
formed-beam data products to commensal FRB and Pulsar experiments; it
constitutes a general spatial-processing system of unprecedented scale and
capability, with correspondingly great challenges in computation, data
transport, heat dissipation, and interference shielding.

In the recent years, the field of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is thriving and
growing rapidly. It is of interest to study cosmology by using FRBs with known
redshifts. In the present work, we try to test the possible cosmic anisotropy
with the simulated FRBs. In particular, we only consider the possible dipole in
FRBs, rather than the cosmic anisotropy in general, while the analysis is only
concerned with finding the rough number of necessary data points to distinguish
a dipole from a monopole structure through simulations. Noting that there is no
a large sample of actual data of FRBs with known redshifts by now, simulations
are necessary to this end. We find that at least 2800, 190, 100 FRBs are
competent to find the cosmic dipole with amplitude 0.01, 0.03, 0.05,
respectively. Unfortunately, even 10000 FRBs are not competent to find the tiny
cosmic dipole with amplitude of ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$. On the other hand, at
least 20 FRBs with known redshifts are competent to find the cosmic dipole with
amplitude 0.1. We expect that such a big cosmic dipole could be ruled out by
using only a few tens of FRBs with known redshifts in the near future.

We consider a simple dynamical and relativistic model to explain the
spectro-temporal structure often displayed by repeating fast radio bursts
(FRBs). We show how this model can account for the downward frequency drift in
a sequence of sub-bursts of increasing arrival time (the "sad trombone" effect)
and their tendency for exhibiting a reduced pulse width with increasing
frequency of observation. Most importantly, this model also predicts a
systematic inverse relationship between the (steeper) slope of the frequency
drift observed within a single sub-burst and its temporal duration. Using
already published data for FRB 121102 we find and verify the relationship
predicted by this model. We therefore argue that the overall behaviour observed
for this object as a function of frequency is consistent with an underlying
narrow-band emission process, where the wide-band nature of the measured FRB
spectrum is due to relativistic motions. Although this scenario and the simple
dynamics we consider could be applied to other theories, they are well-suited
for a model based upon Dicke's superradiance as the physical process
responsible for FRB radiation in this and similar sources.

When the magnetosphere of a magnetar is perturbed by crustal deformation, an
electric field $E_\parallel$ parallel to the magnetic field line would appear
via Alvf\'en waves in the charge starvation region. The electron-positron pair
bunches will be generated via two-stream instability in the magnetosphere, and
these pairs will undergo charge separation in the $E_\parallel$ and in the
meantime emit coherent curvature radiation. Following the approach of Yang &
Zhang (2018), we find that the superposed curvature radiation becomes narrower
due to charge separation, with the width of spectrum depending on the
separation between the electron and positron clumps. This mechanism can
interpret the narrow spectra of FRBs, in particular, the spectrum of Galactic
FRB 200428 recently detected in association with a hard X-ray burst from the
Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154.

FRB~121102 was the first Fast Radio Burst (FRB) that was shown to repeat.
Since its discovery in 2012, more than two hundred bursts have been detected
from the source. These bursts exhibit a diverse range of spectral and temporal
characteristics and many questions about their origin and form remain
unanswered. Here, we present a sample of radio bursts from FRB 121102 detected
using the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory. We show four examples
of bursts that show peculiar spectro-temporal characteristics and compare them
with properties of bursts of FRB~121102 detected at other observatories. We
report on a precursor burst that is separated by just 17~ms from the main
burst, the shortest reported separation between two individual bursts to date.
We also provide access to data for all the detections of FRB~121102 in this
campaign.

Observations of the Faraday rotation measure, combined with the dispersion
measure, can be used to infer the magnetoionic environment of a radio source.
We investigate the magnetoionic environments of FRBs by deriving their
estimated average magnetic field strengths along the line of sight $\langle
B_{\parallel}\rangle$ in their host galaxies and comparing them with those of
Galactic pulsars and magnetars. We find that for those FRBs with RM
measurements, the mean $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ is
$1.77^{+9.01}_{-1.48}\,\rm\mu G$ and $1.74^{+14.82}_{-1.55}\,\rm\mu G$ using
two different methods, which is slightly larger but not inconsistent with the
distribution of Galactic pulsars, $1.00^{+1.51}_{-0.60}\,\rm\mu G$. Only six
Galactic magnetars have estimated $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$. Excluding PSR
J1745--2900 that has an anomalously high value due to its proximity with the
Galactic Centre, the other three sources have a mean value of $1.70\,\rm\mu G$,
which is statistically consistent with the $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$
distributions of both Galactic pulsars and FRBs. There is no apparent trend of
evolution of magnetar $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ as a function of age or
surface magnetic field strength. Galactic pulsars and magnetars close to the
Galactic Centre have relatively larger $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ values
than other pulsars/magnetars. We discuss the implications of these results for
the magnetoionic environments of FRB 121102 within the context of magnetar
model and the model invoking a supermassive black hole, and for the origin of
FRBs in general.

The discovery of a luminous radio burst, FRB 200428, with properties similar
to those of fast radio bursts (FRB), in coincidence with an X-ray flare from
the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, supports magnetar models for cosmological
FRBs. The burst's X-ray to radio fluence ratio, as well as the X-ray spectral
shape and peak energy, are consistent with FRB 200428 being the result of an
ultra-relativistic shock (powered, e.g., by an ejected plasmoid) propagating
into a magnetized baryon-rich external medium; the shock simultaneously
generates X-ray/gamma-rays via thermal synchrotron emission from electrons
heated behind the shock, and coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser
mechanism. Here, we point out that a unique consequence of this baryon-loaded
shock scenario is the generation of a coincident burst of high-energy
neutrinos, generated by photo-hadronic interaction of relativistic ions -
heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We
estimate the properties of these neutrino burst FRB counterparts and find that
a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic
energy) is channeled into production of neutrinos with typical energies ~
TeV-PeV. We conclude by discussing prospects for detecting this signal with
IceCube and future high-energy neutrino detectors.

The discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB) in our galaxy associated with a
magnetar (neutron star with strong magnetic field) has provided a critical
piece of information to help us finally understand these enigmatic transients.
We show that the volumetric rate of Galactic-FRB like events is consistent with
the faint end of the cosmological FRB rate, and hence they most likely belong
to the same class of transients. The Galactic FRB had an accompanying X-ray
burst but many X-ray bursts from the same object had no radio counterpart.
Their relative rates suggest that for every FRB there are roughly 10^2 to 10^3
X-ray bursts. The radio lightcurve of the galactic FRB had two spikes separated
by 30 ms in the 400-800 MHz frequency band. This is an important clue and
highly constraining of the class of models where the radio emission is produced
outside the light-cylinder of the magnetar. We suggest that magnetic
disturbances close to the magnetar surface propagate to a distance of a few
tens of neutron star radii where they damp and produce radio emission. The
coincident hard X-ray spikes associated with the two FRB pulses seen in this
burst and the flux ratio between the two frequency bands can be understood in
this scenario. This model provides a unified picture for faint bursts like the
Galactic FRB as well as the bright events seen at cosmological distances.

A link between magnetars and fast radio burst (FRB) sources has finally been
established. In this context, one of the open issues is whether/which sources
of extra galactic FRBs exhibit X/gamma-ray outbursts and whether it is
correlated with radio activity. We aim to constrain possible X/gamma-ray burst
activity from one of the nearest extragalactic FRB sources currently known over
a broad energy range, by looking for bursts over a range of timescales and
energies that are compatible with being powerful flares from extragalactic
magnetars. We followed up the as-yet nearest extragalactic FRB source at a mere
149 Mpc distance, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, during the active
phase on February 4-7, 2020, with the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope
(HXMT). Taking advantage of the combination of broad band, large effective
area, and several independent detectors available, we searched for bursts over
a set of timescales from 1 ms to 1.024 s with a sensitive algorithm, that had
previously been characterised and optimised. Moreover, through simulations we
studied the sensitivity of our technique in the released energy-duration phase
space for a set of synthetic flares and assuming different energy spectra. We
constrain the possible occurrence of flares in the 1-100 keV energy band to
E<10^46 erg for durations <0.1 s over several tens of ks exposure. We can rule
out the occurrence of giant flares similar to the ones that were observed in
the few cases of Galactic magnetars. The absence of reported radio activity
during our observations does not allow us to make any statements on the
possible simultaneous high-energy emission.

Recently, a fast radio burst (FRB)-like event is found to be associated with
a Galactic magnetar, SGR 1935+2154, accompanied by an X-ray burst. We find this
radio burst challenges the typical emission mechanisms involving magnetars,
which includes coherent curvature radiation from charged bunches, fast
magnetosonic (FMS) wave, synchrotron maser from shocks, and the pulsar-like
mechanism for low-twist magnetars. More specifically, we find that (1) the
X-rays are most-likely to be produced inside the magnetosphere. (2) For the
coherent curvature radiation from the decay of Alfv\'en wave, it will generally
predict a duration ($\lesssim0.1$ ms) smaller than observations, because of the
strong twists of magnetic field lines and the internal damping of Alfv\'en
waves. (3) The FMS wave model predicts a very low emission frequency $\nu_{\rm
p}\sim0.03$ MHz $\ll$ GHz, unless it is produced inside the magnetosphere. But
the absorption effect of the magnetospheric FMS wave model remains to be
studied. (4) The synchrotron maser model is challenged, because observations
show that the peaks in both X-ray and radio light curves are with the same
temporal separation $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}=\Delta t_\gamma\approx0.03$ s, while it
would predict $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}\ll\Delta t_\gamma$. (5) It seems to be
difficult to directly apply the low-twist pulsar-like mechanism to flaring
magnetars, as magnetar activity can significantly deform the magnetosphere. (6)
We suggested four possibilities to study the general properties of FRBs for
future observations, especially the possibility of identifying quasi-periodic
oscillations with period $\sim1-10$ ms in double/multiple-peaked FRBs.

We perform a comparative study between the only radio detected Type I
superluminous supernova (SLSN) PTF10hgi, and the most active repeating fast
radio burst FRB121102. This study has its root in the hypothesized FRB-SLSN
connection that states that magnetars born in SLSN can power FRBs. The wideband
spectrum (0.6--15 GHz) of PTF10hgi presented here, provides strong evidence for
the magnetar wind nebular origin of the radio emission. The same spectrum also
enables us to make robust estimates of the radius and the magnetic field of the
radio emitting region and demonstrates that the nebula is powered by the
rotational energy of the magnetar. This spectrum is then compared with that of
FRB121102 which we extend down to 400 MHz using archival data. The newly added
measurements put very tight constraint on the emission models of the compact
persistent source associated with FRB121102. We find that while both sources
can be powered by the rotational energy of the underlying magnetar, the average
energy injection rate is much higher in FRB121102. Hence, we hypothesise that,
if PTF10hgi is indeed emitting fast radio bursts, those will be much weaker
energetically than those from FRB121102.

We report the findings of a uGMRT observing campaign on FRB 180916.J0158+65,
discovered recently to show a 16.35-day periodicity of its active cycle. We
observed the source at 550-750 MHz for $\sim 2$ hours each during three
successive cycles at the peak of its expected active period. We find 0, 12, and
3 bursts respectively, implying a highly variable bursting rate even within the
active phase. We consistently detect faint bursts with spectral energies only
an order of magnitude higher than the Galactic burst source SGR~1935+2154. The
times of arrival of the detected bursts rule out many possible aliased
solutions, strengthening the findings of the 16.35-day periodicity. A
short-timescale periodicity search returned no highly significant candidates.
Two of the beamformer-detected bursts were bright enough to be clearly detected
in the imaging data, achieving sub-arcsecond localization, and proving as a
proof-of-concept for FRB imaging with the GMRT. We provide a $3\sigma$ upper
limit of the persistent radio flux density at 650 MHz of $66~\mu{\rm Jy}$
which, combined with the EVN and VLA limits at 1.6~GHz, further constrains any
potential radio counterpart. These results demonstrate the power of uGMRT for
targeted observations to detect and localize known repeating FRBs.

Combining high time and frequency resolution full-polarisation spectra of
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with knowledge of their host galaxy properties
provides an opportunity to study both the emission mechanism generating them
and the impact of their propagation through their local environment, host
galaxy, and the intergalactic medium. The Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope has provided the first ensemble of bursts with
this information. In this paper, we present the high time and spectral
resolution, full polarisation observations of five localised FRBs to complement
the results published for the previously studied ASKAP FRB~181112. We find that
every FRB is highly polarised, with polarisation fractions ranging from 80 --
100\%, and that they are generally dominated by linear polarisation. While some
FRBs in our sample exhibit properties associated with an emerging archetype
(i.e., repeating or apparently non-repeating), others exhibit characteristic
features of both, implying the existence of a continuum of FRB properties. When
examined at high time resolution, we find that all FRBs in our sample have
evidence for multiple sub-components and for scattering at a level greater than
expected from the Milky Way. We find no correlation between the diverse range
of FRB properties (e.g., scattering time, intrinsic width, and rotation
measure) and any global property of their host galaxy. The most heavily
scattered bursts reside in the outskirts of their host galaxies, suggesting
that the source-local environment rather than the host interstellar medium is
likely the dominant origin of the scattering in our sample.

I have analyzed the practicality of the Evans Rule in the state based forward
guidance and possible ways to reform it. I examined the biases, measurement
errors, and other limitations extant in the unemployment and the inflation rate
in the Evans Rule. Using time series analysis, I calibrated the thresholds of
ECI wage growth and the employment to population ratio and investigated the
relationship between other labor utilization variables. Then I imposed various
shocks and constructed impulse response functions to contrast the paths of
eight macroeconomic variables under three scenarios. The results suggest that
under the wage growth rate scenario, the federal funds rate lift off earlier
than under the current Evans Rule.

What the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, and whether there are
multiple types of progenitors are open questions. The advent of localized FRBs
with host galaxy redshifts allows the various emission models to be directly
tested for the first time. Given the recent localizations of two non-repeating
FRBs (FRB 180924 and FRB 190523), we discuss a selection of FRB emission models
and demonstrate how we can place constraints on key model parameters like the
magnetic field strength and age of the putative FRB-emitting neutron star. In
particular, we focus on models related to compact binary merger events
involving at least one neutron star, motivated by commonalities between the
host galaxies of the FRBs and the hosts of such merger events/short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs). We rule out the possibility that either FRB was produced during
the final inspiral stage of a merging binary system. Where possible, we predict
the light curve of electromagnetic emission associated with a given model and
use it to recommend multi-wavelength follow-up strategies that may help confirm
or rule out models for future FRBs. In addition, we conduct a targeted
sub-threshold search in Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for potential SGRB
candidates associated with either FRB, and show what a non-detection means for
relevant models. The methodology presented in this study may be easily applied
to future localized FRBs, and adapted to sources with possibly core-collapse
supernova progenitors, to help constrain potential models for the FRB
population at large.

Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are one of the proposed origins for both
repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), which associates FRBs
with gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this work, we
explore detectability of radio afterglows from BNS mergers and compare it to
the observed radio limits on FRB afterglows. We calculate the afterglow flux
powered by the two components: a relativistic jet and a slower isotropic
ejecta, and quantify the detection probability as a function of the source
redshift, observing time, and flux sensitivity. The model parameter
distributions inferred from short GRB afterglows are adopted, and viewing angle
distributions (uniform spherical, gravitational-wave, on-axis biased) are
assumed to reflect different searching scenario. Assuming that FRBs are not
strongly beamed, we make comparison to FRBs detected with reported radio limits
and find the detection probabilities are 1--10% in general, and hence not a
strong constraint on the BNS progenitor model considering the small sample
number (<10). In particular for some nearby FRBs (e.g. 180916.J0158+65,
190608), we find a high chance of detection (>20% at 10$\mu$Jy sensitivity) for
the isotropic component that would peak around $\sim$1--10 years after the
merger. Therefore a long term radio monitoring of persistent radio emission for
these objects is important.

A few fast radio bursts' (FRBs) light-curves have exhibited large intrinsic
modulations of their flux on extremely short ($t_{\rm r}\sim 10\mu$s) time
scales, compared to pulse durations ($t_{\rm FRB}\sim1$ms). Light-curve
variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to pulse
duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the
compactness of the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio
emission. The constraints are strongest when radiation is produced far
($\gtrsim 10^{10}$cm) from the compact object. We describe different physical
set-ups that can account for the observed $t_{\rm r}/t_{\rm FRB}\ll 1$ despite
having large emission radii. The result is either a significant reduction in
the radio production efficiency or distinct light-curves features that could be
searched for in observed data. For the same class of models, we also show that
due to high-latitude emission, if a flux $f_1(\nu_1)$ is observed at $t_1$ then
at a lower frequency $\nu_2<\nu_1$ the flux should be at least
$(\nu_2/\nu_1)^2f_1$ at a slightly later time ($t_2=t_1\nu_1/\nu_2$)
independent of the duration and spectrum of the emission in the comoving frame.
These features can be tested, once light-curve modulations due to scintillation
are accounted for. We provide the timescales and coherence bandwidths of the
latter for a range of possibilities regarding the physical screens and the
scintillation regime. Finally, if future highly resolved FRB light-curves are
shown to have intrinsic variability extending down to $\sim \mu$s timescales,
this will provide strong evidence in favor of magnetospheric models.

Using the results of the IllustrisTNG simulation we estimate the dispersion
measure which may be attributed to halos of so called host galaxies of fast
radio bursts sources (FRBs). Our results show that in contradiction to
assumptions used to show the applicability of FRBs to cosmological tests, both
the dispersion measure and its standard deviation calculated for host galaxies
with given stellar mass in general increase with the redshift. The effect is
not strong and cosmological tests using FRBs will be possible, but to preserve
the level of statistical uncertainty the number of FRBs with known redshift in
a sample should be increased by 15%--35% depending on circumstances. We show
various statistical characteristics of ionized gas surrounding galaxies, the
resulting dispersion measure and their dependence on the host galaxy stellar
mass, redshift, and the projected distance of a FRB source from its host
center.

Recently, the discovery of Galactic FRB 200428 associated with a X-ray burst
(XRB) of SGR 1935+2154 has built a bridge between FRBs and magnetar activities.
In this paper, we assume that the XRB occurs in the magnetar magnetosphere. We
show that the observational properties of FRB 200428 and the associated XRB are
consistent with the predictions of synchrotron maser emission at
ultrarelativistic magnetized shocks, including radiation efficiency, similar
energy occurrence frequency distributions, and simultaneous arrive times. It
requires that the upstream medium is a mildly relativistic baryonic shell
ejected by a previous flare. The energy injection by flares responsible for the
radio bursts will produce a magnetar wind nebula, which has been used to
explain the persistent radio source associated FRB 121102. We find that the
radio continuum around SGR 1935+2154 can be well understood in the magnetar
wind nebula model, by assuming the same energy injection rate $\dot{E} \propto
t^{-1.37}$ as FRB 121102. The required baryonic mass is also estimated form the
observations of FRB 121102 by GBT and FAST. By assuming the same radiation
efficiency $\eta \sim 10^{-5}$, the total baryonic mass ejected from the
central magnetar is about 0.005 solar mass. This value is much larger than the
typical mass of a magnetar outer crust, but is comparable to the total mass of
a magnetar crust.

We report the first discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 20200125A, by
the Green Bank Northern Celestial Cap (GBNCC) Pulsar Survey conducted with the
Green Bank Telescope at 350 MHz. FRB 20200125A was detected at a Galactic
latitude of 58.43 degrees with a dispersion measure of 179 pc cm$^{-3}$, while
electron density models predict a maximum Galactic contribution of 25 pc
cm$^{-3}$ along this line of sight. Moreover, no apparent Galactic foreground
sources of ionized gas that could account for the excess DM are visible in
multi-wavelength surveys of this region. This argues that the source is
extragalactic. The maximum redshift for the host galaxy is $z_{max}=0.17$,
corresponding to a maximum comoving distance of approximately 750 Mpc. The
measured peak flux density for FRB 20200125A is 0.37 Jy, and we measure a pulse
width of 3.7 ms, consistent with the distribution of FRB widths observed at
higher frequencies. Based on this detection and assuming an Euclidean flux
density distribution of FRBs, we calculate an all-sky rate at 350 MHz of
$3.4^{+15.4}_{-3.3} \times 10^3$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux
density of 0.42 Jy for an unscattered pulse having an intrinsic width of 5 ms,
consistent with rates reported at higher frequencies. Given the recent
improvements in our single-pulse search pipeline, we also revisit the GBNCC
survey sensitivity to various burst properties. Finally, we find no evidence of
interstellar scattering in FRB 20200125A, adding to the growing evidence that
some FRBs have circumburst environments where free-free absorption and
scattering are not significant.

CHIME has now detected 18 repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore what
can be learned about the energy distribution and activity level of the
repeaters by fitting realistic FRB population models to the data. For a
power-law energy distribution dN/dE ~ E^{-\gamma} for the repeating bursts,
there is a critical index \gamma_c that controls whether the dispersion measure
(DM, a proxy for source distance) distribution of repeaters is bottom or
top-heavy. We find \gamma_c = 7/4 for Poisson wait-time distribution of
repeaters in Euclidean space and further demonstrate how it is affected by
temporal clustering of repetitions and cosmological effects. It is especially
interesting that two of the CHIME repeaters (FRB 181017 and 190417) have large
DM ~ 1000 pc/cm^3. These can be understood if: (i) the energy distribution is
shallow \gamma = 1.7^{+0.3}_{-0.1} (68% confidence) or (ii) a small fraction of
sources are extremely active. In the second scenario, these two high-DM sources
should be repeating more than 100 times more frequently than FRB 121102, and
the energy index is constrained to be \gamma = 1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2} (68%
confidence). In either case, this \gamma is consistent with the energy
dependence of the non-repeating ASKAP sample, which suggests that they are
drawn from the same population. Finally, our model predicts how the CHIME
repeating fraction should decrease with redshift, and this can be compared with
observations to infer the distribution of activity level in the whole
population.

When fast radio burst (FRB) waves propagate through the local (< 1 pc)
environment of the FRB source, electrons in the plasma undergo large-amplitude
oscillations. The finite-amplitude effects cause the effective plasma frequency
and cyclotron frequency to be dependent on the wave strength. The dispersion
measure and rotation measure should therefore vary slightly from burst to burst
for a repeating source, depending on the luminosity and frequency of the
individual burst. Furthermore, free-free absorption of strong waves is
suppressed due to the accelerated electrons' reduced energy exchange in Coulomb
collisions. This allows bright low-frequency bursts to propagate through an
environment that would be optically thick to low-amplitude waves. Given a large
sample of bursts from a repeating source, it would be possible to use the
deficit of low-frequency and low-luminosity bursts to infer the emission
measure of the local intervening plasma and its distance from the source.
Information about the local environment will shed light on the nature of FRB
sources.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10225v2
We present a method to estimate the source properties of FRBs from
observations by assuming a fixed DM contribution from a MW-like host galaxy,
pulse temporal broadening models for turbulent plasma and a flat FRB energy
spectrum. We then perform Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the properties
of the FRB source, its host galaxy and scattering in the intervening plasma
from the observational data of FRBs detected with Parkes. The typical scatter
broadening of the intrinsic pulse is found to be considerably small $\lesssim
10^{-2}-1\ {\rm ms}$ from physical models, with the ISM contribution suppressed
significantly relative to IGM. The intrinsic width for non-repeating FRBs is
broadened by a factor $\sim 2-3$ on average primarily due to dispersive
smearing. From the simulations, we find that the host galaxy DM contribution is
likely to be comparable to the Galactic contribution and the FRB energy
decreases significantly at high frequencies with a negative spectral index. The
FRB spatial density is found to increase up to redshift $\sim 2.0$ and then
drops significantly at larger distances. We obtain the energy distribution for
FRB 121102 with repetition rate $\sim 0.1-0.3\ {\rm hr^{-1}}$ and exponential
energy cutoff that is significantly smaller compared to typical FRB energies.
We find that the probability of observing none of the other FRBs to be
repeating at Parkes is $\sim 0.8-0.9$ with the current follow-up data
insufficient to suggest more than one class of FRB progenitors.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious extragalactic radio signals.
Revealing their origin is one of the central foci in modern astronomy. Previous
studies suggest that occurrence rates of non-repeating and repeating FRBs could
be controlled by the cosmic stellar-mass density (CSMD) and star formation-rate
density (CSFRD), respectively. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is one of the
best future instruments to address this subject due to its high sensitivity and
high-angular resolution. Here, we predict the number of FRBs to be detected
with the SKA. In contrast to previous predictions, we estimate the detections
of non-repeating and repeating FRBs separately, based on latest observational
constraints on their physical properties including the spectral indices, FRB
luminosity functions, and their redshift evolutions. We consider two cases of
redshift evolution of FRB luminosity functions following either the CSMD or
CSFRD. At $z\gtrsim2$, $z\gtrsim6$ and $z\gtrsim10$, non-repeating FRBs will be
detected with the SKA at a rate of $\sim10^{4}$, $\sim10^{2}$, and $\sim10$
(sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$), respectively, if their luminosity function follows the
CSMD evolution. At $z\gtrsim1$, $z\gtrsim2$, and $z\gtrsim4$, sources of
repeating FRBs will be detected at a rate of $\sim10^{3}$, $\sim10^{2}$, and
$\lesssim10$ (sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$), respectively, assuming that the redshift
evolution of their luminosity function is scaled with the CSFRD. These numbers
could change by about one order of magnitude depending on the assumptions on
the CSMD and CSFRD. In all cases, abundant FRBs will be detected by the SKA,
which will further constrain the luminosity functions and number density
evolutions.

We calculate the dispersion measures (DMs) contributed by host galaxies of
fast radio bursts (FRBs). Based on a few host galaxy observations, a large
sample of galaxy with similar properties to observed ones has been selected
from the IllustrisTNG simulation. They are used to compute the distributions of
host galaxy DMs for repeating and non-repeating FRBs. For repeating FRBs, we
infer the DM$ _{\mathrm{host}} $ for FRBs like FRB 121102 and FRB 180916 by
assuming that the burst sites are tracing the star formation rates in host
galaxies. The median DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ are $35 (1+z)^{1.08}$ and
$96(1+z)^{0.83}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ for FRBs like FRB 121102 and FRB 180916,
respectively. In another case, the median of DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ is about $30
- 70$ pc cm$^{-3}$ for non-repeating FRBs in the redshift range $z=0.1-1.5$,
assuming that the burst sites are the locations of binary neutron star mergers.
In this case, the evolution of the median DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ can be
calculated by $33(1+z)^{0.84}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The distributions of
DM$_{\mathrm{host}}$ of repeating and non-repeating FRBs can be well fitted
with the log-normal function. Our results can be used to infer redshifts of
non-localized FRBs.

Recent arcsecond localizations of Fast Radio Bursts and identifications of
their host galaxies confirmed their extragalactic origin.While FRB 121102
resides in the bright region of a dwarf star forming galaxy, other FRBs reside
in more massive galaxies and are related to older stellar populations. We
compare the host galaxy properties of {nine} FRBs with those of several types
of stellar transients: from young to old population, long duration gamma ray
bursts (LGRBs), superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), Type Ib/Ic supernovae (SN
Ibc), Type II supernovae (SN II), type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), and short
duration gamma ray bursts (SGRBs). We find that as a whole sample, the stellar
mass and star formation rate of the FRB host galaxies prefer a medium to old
population, and are against a young population similar to LGRBs and SLSNe by a
null probability 0.02. Individually, the FRB 121102 host is consistent with
that of young population objects; the FRB 180924 environment is similar to that
of SGRBs; and the FRB 190523 environment is similar to those of SN Ia. These
results are consistent with the magnetar engine model for FRBs, if both
magnetars produced from extreme explosions (GRBs/SLSNe) and from regular
channels (e.g. those producing Galactic magnetars) can produce FRBs.

A fast radio burst (FRB) was recently detected to be associated with a hard
X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. Scenarios involving
magnetars for FRBs are hence highly favored. In this work, we suggest that the
impact between an asteroid and a magnetar could explain such a detection.
According to our calculations, an asteroid of mass $10^{20}$ g will be
disrupted at a distance of $7 \times 10^9$ cm when approaching the magnetar.
The accreted material will flow along the magnetic field lines from the
Alfv\'en radius $\sim 10^7$ cm. After falling onto the magnetar's surface, an
instant accretion column will be formed, producing a Comptonized X-ray burst
and an FRB in the magnetosphere. We show that all the observational features of
FRB 200428 could be interpreted self-consistently in this scenario. We predict
quasi-periodic oscillations in this specific X-ray burst, which can serve as an
independent observational test.

The turbulence in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) plays an important
role in various astrophysical processes across cosmic time, but it is very
challenging to constrain its statistical properties both observationally and
numerically. Via the statistical analysis of turbulence along different
sightlines toward a population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we demonstrate that
FRBs provide a unique tool to probe the intergalactic turbulence. We measure
the structure function (SF) of dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs to study the
multi-scale electron density fluctuations induced by the intergalactic
turbulence. The SF has a large amplitude and a Kolmogorov power-law scaling
with angular separations, showing large and correlated DM fluctuations over a
range of length scales. Given that the DMs of FRBs are IGM dominated, our
result tentatively suggests that the intergalactic turbulence has a Kolmogorov
power spectrum and an outer scale on the order of $100$ Mpc.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11930v3
It is currently not known if repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are
fundamentally different from those that have not been seen to repeat. One
striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME
sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than
sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple
explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed
emission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but
are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation
predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration---not a
static bimodal one---with a correlation between repetition rate and width.
Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks,
where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common
Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect
where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars. Our
model has implications for the FRB emission mechanism and energy scale,
volumetric event rates, and the application of FRBs to cosmology.

Wave effects are often neglected in microlensing studies; however, for
coherent point-like sources, such as pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), wave
effects will become important in their gravitational lensing. In this paper, we
describe the wave optics formalism, its various limits, and the conditions for
which these limits hold. Using the simple point lens as an example, we will
show that the frequency dependence of wave effects breaks degeneracies that are
present in the usual geometric optics limit, and constructive interference
results in larger magnifications further from the lens. This latter fact leads
to a generic increase in cross section for microlensing events in the
wave-optics regime compared to the geometric optics regime. For realistic
percent-level spectral sensitivities, this leads to a relative boost in lensing
cross section of more than an order of magnitude. We apply the point-lens model
to the lensing of FRBs and pulsars and find that these radio sources will be
lensed in the full wave-optics regime by isolated masses in the range of
$0.1-100\,M_\oplus$, which includes free-floating planets (FFPs), whose
Einstein radius is smaller than the Fresnel scale. More generally, the
interference pattern allows an instantaneous determination of lens masses,
unlike traditional microlensing techniques which only yield a mass inference
from the event timescale.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04054v1
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astrophysical transients of currently unknown
origin, and so far several events have been detected at extragalactic
distances. The dispersion measure (DM) of the radio signal is a probe of the
integrated electron density along the line of sight and therefore allows to map
the electron distribution within the large-scale structure. Since a fraction of
electrons gets expelled from galaxies by feedback, they are anticorrelated with
halos at large scales and hence the angular DM correlations show a
scale-dependent bias caused by primordial non-Gaussianity. Although the signal
is weaker than in other probes like galaxy clustering, FRBs can potentially
probe considerably larger volumes. We show that while studying the FRB
clustering signal requires very large samples, correlations in the DM are
cosmic-variance limited on large angular scales with only $\sim 10^{3-4}$
events. A tomographic analysis of the angular DM correlation function can
constrain the local primordial bispectrum shape parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$ to a
precision down to ${f_\mathrm{NL}}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ depending on assumptions
about the FRB redshift distribution and the astrophysical feedback on large
scales. This makes FRBs a competitive probe to constrain inflationary physics.

Due to differing gravitational potentials and path lengths, gravitational
lensing induces time delays between multiple images of a source which, for
solar mass objects, is of order $\sim10^{-5}$ seconds. If an astrophysically
compact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through a region
with a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational
lensing time delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In
this paper, we consider the impact of the parity of the macroimage on the
resultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity is directly
imprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the
time arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and
then progressing to the fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of
the time arrival surface, this situation is reversed, with fainter images
observed first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For macroimages at
saddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by
brighter images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The
growing populations of cosmologically distant bursty transient sources will
undoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply imaged FRBs,
which will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal
resolution being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of
microlensing induced time delays will reveal the parities of the gravitational
lens macroimages, providing additional constraints on macrolensing mass models
and improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological probes.

The pulse morphology of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides key information in
both understanding progenitor physics and the plasma medium through which the
burst propagates. We present a study of the profiles of 33 bright FRBs detected
by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. We identify seven FRBs
with measureable intrinsic pulse widths, including two FRBs that have been seen
to repeat. In our modest sample we see no evidence for bimodality in the pulse
width distribution. We also identify five FRBs with evidence of millisecond
timescale pulse broadening caused by scattering in inhomogeneous plasma. We
find no evidence for a relationship between pulse broadening and extragalactic
dispersion measure. The scattering could be either caused by extreme turbulence
in the host galaxy or chance propagation through foreground galaxies. With
future high time resolution observations and detailed study of host galaxy
properties we may be able to probe line-of-sight turbulence on gigaparsec
scales.

The Galactic magnetar SGR1935+2154 has been reported to produce the first
known example of a bright millisecond duration radio burst (FRB 200428) similar
to the cosmological population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), bolstering the
association of FRBs to active magnetars. The detection of a coincident bright
X-ray burst has revealed the first observed multi-wavelength counterpart of a
FRB. However, the search for similar emission at optical wavelengths has been
hampered by the high inferred extinction on the line of sight. Here, we present
results from the first search for second-timescale emission from the source at
near-infrared wavelengths using the Palomar Gattini-IR observing system in
J-band, made possible by a recently implemented detector read-out mode that
allowed for short exposure times of 0.84 s with 99.9% observing efficiency.
With a total observing time of 12 hours (47728 images) on source, we place
median $3\,\sigma$ limits on the second-timescale emission of $< 20$ mJy (13.1
AB mag). We present non-detection limits from epochs of four simultaneous X-ray
bursts detected by the Insight-{\it HXMT} and {\it NuSTAR} telescopes during
our observing campaign. The limits translate to an extinction corrected fluence
limit of $< 125$ Jy ms for an estimated extinction of $A_J = 2.0$ mag. These
limits provide the most stringent constraints to date on the fluence of flares
at frequencies of $\sim 10^{14}$ Hz, and constrain the ratio of the
near-infrared (NIR) fluence to that of coincident X-ray bursts to $R_{\rm NIR}
< 2.5 \times 10^{-2}$. Our observations were sensitive enough to easily detect
a near-infrared counterpart of FRB 200428 if the NIR emission falls on the same
power law as that observed across its radio to X-ray spectrum. The
non-detection of NIR emission around the coincident X-ray bursts constrains the
fluence index of the brightest burst to be steeper than $0.35$.

The dispersion measure (DM) is one of the key attributes of radio pulsars and
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). There is a mistaken view that the DM is an accurate
measure of the column density of electrons between the observer and the source.
To start with, the DM, unlike a true column density, is not a Lorentz
invariant. Next, the DM also includes contribution from ions and is sensitive
to the temperature of the plasma in the intervening clouds. Separately, the
primary observable is the dispersion slope, $\mathcal{D}\equiv
\Delta{(t)}/\Delta{(\nu^{-2}})$, where $t(\nu)$ is the arrival time at
frequency, $\nu$. A scaling factor composed of physical and astronomical
constants is needed to convert $\mathcal{D}$ to DM. In the early days of pulsar
astronomy the relevant constants were defined to parts per million (ppm). As a
result, a convention arose in which this conversion factor was fixed. Over
time, several such conventions came about -- recipe for confusion. Meanwhile,
over the past several years, the SI system has been restructured and the parsec
is now exactly defined. As a result, the present accuracy of the conversion
factor is below a part per billion -- many orders of magnitude better than the
best measurement errors of $\mathcal{D}$. We are now in an awkward situation
wherein the primary "observable", the DM, has incorrect scaling factor(s). To
address these two concerns I propose that astronomers report the primary
measurement, $\mathcal{D}$ (with a suggested normalization of $10^{15}\,$Hz),
and not the DM. Interested users can convert $\mathcal{D}$ to DM without the
need to know secret handshakes of the pulsar timing communities.

We present the discovery and subarcsecond localization of a new Fast Radio
Burst with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and realfast search system. The
FRB was discovered on 2019 June 14 with a dispersion measure of 959 pc/cm3.
This is the highest DM of any localized FRB and its measured burst fluence of
0.6 Jy ms is less than nearly all other FRBs. The source is not detected to
repeat in 15 hours of VLA observing and 153 hours of CHIME/FRB observing. We
describe a suite of statistical and data quality tests we used to verify the
significance of the event and its localization precision. Follow-up
optical/infrared photometry with Keck and Gemini associate the FRB to a pair of
galaxies with $\rm{r}\sim23$ mag. The false-alarm rate for radio transients of
this significance that are associated with a host galaxy is roughly
$3\times10^{-4}\ \rm{hr}^{-1}$. The two putative host galaxies have similar
photometric redshifts of $z_{\rm{phot}}\sim0.6$, but different colors and
stellar masses. Comparing the host distance to that implied by the dispersion
measure suggests a modest (~ 50 pc/cm3) electron column density associated with
the FRB environment or host galaxy/galaxies.

We report on the lowest-frequency detection to date of three bursts from the
fast radio burst FRB 180916, observed at 328 MHz with the Sardinia Radio
Telescope (SRT). The SRT observed the periodic repeater FRB 180916 for five
days from 2020 February 20 to 24 during a time interval of active radio
bursting, and detected the three bursts during the first hour of observations;
no more bursts were detected during the remaining ~ 30 hours. Simultaneous SRT
observations at 1548 MHz did not detect any bursts. Burst fluences are in the
range 37 to 13 Jy ms. No relevant scattering is observed for these bursts. We
also present the results of the multi-wavelength campaign we performed on FRB
180916, during the five days of the active window. Simultaneously with the SRT
observations, others with different time spans were performed with the Northern
Cross at 408 MHz, with XMM-Newton, NICER, INTEGRAL, AGILE, and with the TNG and
two optical telescopes in Asiago, which are equipped with fast photometers.
XMM-Newton obtained data simultaneously with the three bursts detected by the
SRT, and determined a luminosity upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of
~$10^{45}$ erg/s for the burst emission. AGILE obtained data simultaneously
with the first burst and determined a fluence upper limit in the MeV range for
millisecond timescales of $ 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$.Our results show that
absorption from the circumburst medium does not significantly affect the
emission from FRB 180916, thus limiting the possible presence of a
superluminous supernova around the source, and indicate that a cutoff for the
bursting mechanism, if present, must be at lower frequencies. Our
multi-wavelength campaign sensitively constrains the broadband emission from
FRB 180916, and provides the best limits so far for the electromagnetic
response to the radio bursting of this remarkable source of fast radio bursts.

A recent discovery of the periodic activity of the repeating fast radio burst
source FRB 180916.J0158+65 in the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) hints at possible origin of the FRB from a freely precessing
neutron star with a magnetar magnetic field of about $10^{16}$ G. However, the
absence of simultaneously detected high-energy emission in the Swift and AGILE
observations imposes stringent constraints on the field magnitude and questions
the possibility of such a progenitor. We show that consideration of forced
precession of a neutron star does not encounter the difficulty. This kind of
precession takes place even if the neutron star is not deformed and is brought
about by the anomalous moment of electromagnetic forces induced by stellar
rotation and determined by non-corotational currents. Contrary to what is
expected for the currents of corotation, the anomalous torque calculated by the
direct method appears to be non-zero. If the observed 16.35-day period
corresponds to the period of stellar precession, the inferred internal magnetic
field appears to be about $6\times10^{14}$ G for rotational period 1 s. For
another possibly periodic FRB 121102 with 157-day period the magnetic field is
even lower, $2\times10^{14}$ G, thereby justifying earlier considerations and
not ruling out the hypothesis of FRB origin from precessing neutron stars.

Owing to the detection of an extremely bright fast radio burst (FRB) 200428
associated with a hard X-ray counterpart from the magnetar soft gamma-ray
repeater (SGR) 1935+2154, the distance of SGR 1935+2154 potentially hosted in
the supernova remnant (SNR) G57.2+0.8 can be revisited. Under the assumption
that the SGR and the SNR are physically related, in this Letter, by
investigating the dispersion measure (DM) of the FRB contributed by the
foreground medium of our Galaxy and the local environments and combining with
other observational constraints, we find that the distance of SGR 1935+2154
turns out to be $9.0\pm2.5\,$kpc and the SNR radius falls into $10$ to $18\,$pc
since the local DM contribution is as low as $0-18\,$pc cm$^{-3}$. These
results are basically consistent with the previous studies. In addition, an
estimate for the Faraday rotation measure of the SGR and SNR is also carried
out.

A bright radio burst was newly discovered in SGR 1935+2154, which exhibit
some FRB-like temporal- and frequency-properties, suggesting a neutron star
(NS)/magnetar magnetospheric origin of FRBs. We propose an explanation of the
temporal- and frequency-properties of sub-pulses of repeating FRBs based on the
generic geometry within the framework of charged-bunching coherent curvature
radiation in the magnetosphere of an NS. The sub-pulses in a radio burst come
from bunches of charged particles moving along different magnetic field lines.
Their radiation beam sweep across the line of sight at slightly different time,
and those radiating at the more curved part tend to be seen earlier and at
higher frequency. However, by considering bunches generated at slightly
different times, we find there is also a small probability that the emission
from the less curved part be seen earlier. We simulate the time--frequency
structures by deriving various forms of the electric acceleration field in the
magnetosphere. Such structure of sub-pulses is a natural consequence of
coherent curvature radiation from an NS magnetosphere with suddenly and
violently triggered sparks. We apply this model to explain the time--frequency
structure within specific dipolar configuration by invoking the transient
pulsar-like sparking from the inner gap of a slowly rotating NS, and have also
developed in more generic configurations.

We propose a compact binary model with an eccentric orbit to explain
periodically active fast radio burst (FRB) sources, where the system consists
of a neutron star (NS) with strong dipolar magnetic fields and a magnetic white
dwarf (WD). In our model, the WD fills its Roche lobe at periastron, and mass
transfer occurs from the WD to the NS around this point. The accreted material
may be fragmented into a number of parts, which arrive at the NS at different
times. The fragmented magnetized material may trigger magnetic reconnection
near the NS surface. The electrons can be accelerated to an ultra-relativistic
speed, and therefore the curvature radiation of the electrons can account for
the burst activity. In this scenario, the duty cycle of burst activity is
related to the orbital period of the binary. We show that such a model may work
for duty cycles roughly from ten minutes to two days. For the recently reported
16.35-day periodicity of FRB 180916.J0158+65, our model does not naturally
explain such a long duty cycle, since an extremely high eccentricity ($e>0.95$)
is required.

Very recently, an extremely bright fast radio burst (FRB) 200428 with two
sub-millisecond pulses was discovered to come from the direction of the
Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, and an X-ray burst (XRB) counterpart was
detected simultaneously. These observations favor magnetar-based
interior-driven models. In this Letter, we propose a different model for FRB
200428 associated with an XRB from SGR 1935+2154, in which a magnetar with high
proper velocity encounters an asteroid of mass $\sim10^{20}\,$g. This infalling
asteroid in the stellar gravitational field is first possibly disrupted tidally
into a great number of fragments at radius $\sim {\rm a\,\,few}$ times
$10^{10}\,$cm, and then slowed around the Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n radius by an
ultra-strong magnetic field and in the meantime two major fragments of mass
$\sim 10^{17}\,$g that cross magnetic field lines produce two pulses of FRB
200428. The whole asteroid is eventually accreted onto the poles along magnetic
field lines, impacting the stellar surface, creating a photon-e$^\pm$ pair
fireball trapped initially in the stellar magnetosphere, and further leading to
an XRB. We show that this gravitationally-powered model can interpret all of
the observed features self-consistently.

We report on the detection of a burst from FRB180916 by realfast/VLA and
present software for interpreting fast radio bursts (FRB) periodicity. We
demonstrate a range of periodicity analyses with bursts from FRB180916,
FRB121102 and FRB180814. Our results for FRB180916 and FRB121102 are consistent
with published results. For FRB180814, we did not detect any significant
periodic episodes. The realfast-detected and other high-frequency bursts for
FRB180916 tend to lie at the beginning of the activity window, indicating a
possible phase-frequency relation. The python package $\texttt{frbpa}$ can be
used to reproduce and expand on this analysis to test models for repeating
FRBs.

With the upcoming commensal surveys for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and their
high candidate rate, usage of machine learning algorithms for candidate
classification is a necessity. Such algorithms will also play a pivotal role in
sending real-time triggers for prompt follow-ups with other instruments. In
this paper, we have used the technique of Transfer Learning to train the
state-of-the-art deep neural networks for classification of FRB and Radio
Frequency Interference (RFI) candidates. These are convolutional neural
networks which work on radio frequency-time and dispersion measure-time images
as the inputs. We trained these networks using simulated FRBs and real RFI
candidates from telescopes at the Green Bank Observatory. We present 11 deep
learning models, each with an accuracy and recall above 99.5% on our test
dataset comprising of real RFI and pulsar candidates. As we demonstrate, these
algorithms are telescope and frequency agnostic and are able to detect all FRBs
with signal-to-noise ratios above 10 in ASKAP and Parkes data. We also provide
an open-source python package FETCH (Fast Extragalactic Transient Candidate
Hunter) for classification of candidates, using our models. Using FETCH, these
models can be deployed along with any commensal search pipeline for real-time
candidate classification.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-scale radio pulses, which originate
in distant galaxies and are produced by unknown sources. The mystery remains
partially because of the typical difficulty in localising FRBs to host
galaxies. Accurate localisations delivered by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP
Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey now provide an opportunity to study the host
galaxies and potential transient counterparts of FRBs at a large range of
wavelengths. In this work, we investigate whether the first three FRBs
accurately localised by CRAFT have supernova-like transient counterparts. We
obtained two sets of imaging epochs with the Very Large Telescope for three
host galaxies, one soon after the burst detection and one several months later.
After subtracting these images no optical counterparts were identified in the
associated FRB host galaxies, so we instead place limits on the brightness of
any potential optical transients. A Monte Carlo approach, in which supernova
light curves were modelled and their base properties randomised, was used to
estimate the probability of a supernova associated with each FRB going
undetected. We conclude that Type Ia and IIn supernovae are unlikely to
accompany every apparently non-repeating FRB.

The discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB) associated with a magnetar in the
Milky Way by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB
collaboration (CHIME/FRB) and the Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio
Emission 2 (STARE2) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to refine FRB
emission models. The burst discovered by CHIME/FRB shows two components with
different spectra. We explore interstellar scintillation as the origin for this
variation in spectral structure. Modeling a weak scattering screen in the
supernova remnant associated with the magnetar, we find that a superluminal
apparent transverse velocity of the emission region of $>9.5\,c$ is needed to
explain the spectral variation. Alternatively, the two components could have
originated from independent emission regions spaced by $>8.3\times10^4\,$km.
These scenarios may arise in "far-away" models where the emission originates
from well beyond the magnetosphere of the magnetar (for example through a
synchrotron-maser mechanism set up by an ultra-relativistic radiative shock),
but not in "close-in" models of emission from within the magnetosphere. If
further radio observations of the magnetar confirm scintillation as the source
for the observed variation in spectral structure, this scattering model thus
constrains the location of the emission region.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13037v1
It is proposed that sources of repeating fast radio bursts with detected
periodicity are magnetars with extremely short initial spin periods at the
protoneutron star stage, formed in binaries after tidal synchronization of
their progenitor cores on late stages of thermonuclear burning in very close
systems with orbital periods about a few days. This formation channel is in
several respects different from evolution of progenitors of normal magnetars,
and thus, it explains some differences between repeating and non-repeating
sources of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12509v2
The recurrent fast radio burst FRB 180916 was recently shown to exhibit a 16
day period (with possible aliasing) in its bursting activity. Given magnetars
as widely considered FRB sources, this period has been attributed to precession
of the magnetar spin axis or the orbit of a binary companion. Here, we make the
simpler connection to a {\it rotational period}, an idea observationally
motivated by the 6.7 hour period of the Galactic magnetar candidate, 1E
161348--5055. We explore three physical mechanisms that could lead to the
creation of ultra long period magnetars: (i) enhanced spin-down due to episodic
mass-loaded charged particle winds (e.g. as may accompany giant flares), (ii)
angular momentum kicks from giant flares and (iii) fallback leading to long
lasting accretion disks. We show that particle winds and fallback accretion can
potentially lead to a sub-set of the magnetar population with ultra long
periods, sufficiently long to accommodate FRB 180916 or 1E 161348--5055. If
confirmed, such periods implicate magnetars in relatively mature states (ages
$1-10$ kyr) and which possessed large internal magnetic fields at birth $B_{\rm
int}\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G. In the low-twist magnetar model for FRBs, such long
period magnetars may dominate FRB production for repeaters at lower
isotropic-equivalent energies and broaden the energy distribution beyond that
expected for a canonical population of magnetars which terminate their magnetic
activity at shorter periods $P \lesssim 10$ s.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio transients
originating from extragalactic distances. Their origin is unknown. Some FRB
sources emit repeat bursts, ruling out cataclysmic origins for those events.
Despite searches for periodicity in repeat burst arrival times on time scales
from milliseconds to many days, these bursts have hitherto been observed to
appear sporadically, and though clustered, without a regular pattern. Here we
report the detection of a $16.35\pm0.15$ day periodicity (or possibly a
higher-frequency alias of that periodicity) from a repeating FRB
180916.J0158+65 detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment
Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB). In 38 bursts recorded from September
16th, 2018 through February 4th, 2020, we find that all bursts arrive in a
5-day phase window, and 50% of the bursts arrive in a 0.6-day phase window. Our
results suggest a mechanism for periodic modulation either of the burst
emission itself, or through external amplification or absorption, and disfavour
models invoking purely sporadic processes.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10328v1
The newly discovered 16.35 days period for repeating FRB 180916.J0158+65
provides an essential clue for understanding the sources and emission mechanism
of repeating FRBs. Many models propose that the periodically repeating FRBs
might be related to binary star systems that contain at least one neutron star
(NSC-FRB system). It has been suggested that the NS "combed" by the strong wind
from a companion star might provide a solution. Following the "Binary Comb"
model, we use the population synthesis method to study in detail the properties
of the companion stars and the nature of NSC-FRB systems. Our main findings
are: 1) the companion star is most likely to be a B-type star; 2) the period of
16 days of FRB 180916 happens to fall in the most probable period range, which
may explain why FRB 180916 was the first detected periodically repeating FRB,
and we expect to observe more periodically repeating FRBs with periods around
10-30 days; 3) the birth rate for NSC-FRB system is large enough to fulfill the
event rate requirement set by the observation of FRB 180916, which supports the
proposal that NSC-FRB can provide one significant channel for producing
periodically repeating FRBs.

A nonzero-mass hypothesis for the photon can produces a frequency-dependent
dispersion of light, which results in arrival-time differences of photons with
different frequencies originating from a given transient source. Extragalactic
fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their low frequency emissions, short time
durations, and long propagation distances, are excellent astrophysical probes
to constrain the rest mass of the photon $m_{\gamma}$. However, the derivation
of a limit on $m_{\gamma}$ is complicated by the similar frequency dependences
of dispersion expected from the plasma and nonzero photon mass effects. If a
handful measurements of redshift for FRBs are available, the different redshift
dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to the dispersion
measure (DM) might be able to break dispersion degeneracy in testing the photon
mass. For now, nine FRBs with redshift measurements have been reported, which
can turn this idea into reality. Taking into account the DM contributions from
both the plasma and a possible photon mass, we use the data on the nine FRBs to
derive a combined limit of $m_{\gamma}\leq7.1\times10^{-51}\;{\rm kg}$, or
equivalently $m_{\gamma}\leq4.0\times10^{-15}\; {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ at 68\%
confidence level, which is essentially as good as or represents a factor of 7
improvement over previous limits obtained by the single FRBs. Additionally, a
reasonable estimation for the DM contribution from the host galaxy, $\rm
DM_{host}$, can be simultaneously achieved in our analysis. The rapid progress
in localizing FRBs will further tighten the constraints on both $m_{\gamma}$
and $\rm DM_{host}$.

We present 11 detections of FRB 121102 in ~3 hours of observations during its
'active' period on the 10th of September 2019. The detections were made using
the newly deployed MeerTRAP system and single pulse detection pipeline at the
MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. Fortuitously, the Nancay radio
telescope observations on this day overlapped with the last hour of MeerKAT
observations and resulted in 4 simultaneous detections. The observations with
MeerKAT's wide band receiver, which extends down to relatively low frequencies
(900-1670 MHz usable L-band range), have allowed us to get a detailed look at
the complex frequency structure, intensity variations and frequency-dependent
sub-pulse drifting. The drift rates we measure for the full-band and sub-banded
data are consistent with those published between 600-6500 MHz with a slope of
-0.147 +/- 0.014 ms^-1. Two of the detected bursts exhibit fainter 'precursors'
separated from the brighter main pulse by ~28 ms and ~34 ms. A follow-up
multi-telescope campaign on the 6th and 8th October 2019 to better understand
these frequency drifts and structures over a wide and continuous band was
undertaken. No detections resulted, indicating that the source was 'inactive'
over a broad frequency range during this time.

Magnetars are highly magnetized young neutron stars that occasionally produce
enormous bursts and flares of X-rays and gamma-rays. Of the approximately
thirty magnetars currently known in our Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, five have
exhibited transient radio pulsations. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are
millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves arriving from cosmological
distances. Some have been seen to repeat. A leading model for repeating FRBs is
that they are extragalactic magnetars, powered by their intense magnetic
fields. However, a challenge to this model has been that FRBs must have radio
luminosities many orders of magnitude larger than those seen from known
Galactic magnetars. Here we report the detection of an extremely intense radio
burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 using the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB project. The fluence of this
two-component bright radio burst and the estimated distance to SGR 1935+2154
together imply a 400-800 MHz burst energy of $\sim 3 \times 10^{34}$ erg, which
is three orders of magnitude brighter than those of any radio-emitting magnetar
detected thus far. Such a burst coming from a nearby galaxy would be
indistinguishable from a typical FRB. This event thus bridges a large fraction
of the radio energy gap between the population of Galactic magnetars and FRBs,
strongly supporting the notion that magnetars are the origin of at least some
FRBs.

The recent discovery of a millisecond radio burst from the Galactic magnetar
SGR 1935+2154 has initiated an intense discussion about the connection between
magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although some properties of the radio
burst from SGR 1935+2154 are not the same as cosmological FRBs, there are
theoretical models which propose a connection between magnetars and FRBs (see
review by Margalit et al. 2020). In particular, the role of a magnetar wind
nebula is included in some models, and therefore it is worthwhile to
investigate the X-ray environment of SGR 1935+2154 in more detail. Here, we
report on the discovery of an X-ray transient feature near SGR 1935+2154 using
archival Chandra data and discuss its possible origin.

We report results of a novel high-energy follow-up observation of a potential
Fast Radio Burst. The radio burst was detected by VLA/realfast and followed-up
by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in very low latency utilizing new
operational capabilities of Swift (arXiv:2005.01751), with pointed soft X-ray
and UV observations beginning at T0+32 minutes, and hard X-ray/gamma-ray event
data saved around T0. These observations are $>10$x faster than previous
X-ray/UV follow-up of any radio transient to date. No emission is seen
coincident with the FRB candidate at T0, with a 0.2s fluence $5\sigma$ upper
limit of $1.35\times10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (14-195 keV) for a SGR
1935+2154-like flare, nor at T0+32 minutes down to $3\sigma$ upper limits of
22.18 AB mag in UVOT u band, and $3.33\times10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
from 0.3-10 keV for the 2 ks observation. The candidate FRB alone is not
significant enough to be considered astrophysical, so this note serves as a
technical demonstration. These new Swift operational capabilities will allow
future FRB detections to be followed up with Swift at even lower latencies than
demonstrated here: 15-20 minutes should be regularly achievable, and 5-10
minutes occasionally achievable. We encourage FRB detecting facilities to
release alerts in low latency to enable this science.

We introduce a new technique to constrain the line-of-sight integrated
electron density of our Galactic halo $\text{DM}_\text{MW,halo}$ through
analysis of the observed dispersion measure distributions of pulsars
$\text{DM}_\text{pulsar}$ and fast radio bursts $\text{DM}_\text{FRB}$. We
model these distributions, correcting for the Galactic interstellar medium,
with kernel density estimation---well-suited to the small data regime---to find
lower/upper bounds to the corrected
$\text{DM}_\text{pulsar}$/$\text{DM}_\text{FRB}$ distributions:
$\max[\text{DM}_\text{pulsar}] \approx 7\pm2 \text{ (stat)} \pm 9 \text{ (sys)
pc cm}^{-3}$ and $\min[\text{DM}_\text{FRB}] \approx 63^{+27}_{-21} \text{
(stat)} \pm 9 \text{ (sys) pc cm}^{-3}$. Using bootstrap resampling to estimate
uncertainties, we set conservative limits on the Galactic halo dispersion
measure $-2 < \text{DM}_\text{MW,halo} < 123 \text{pc cm}^{-3}$ (95\% c.l.).
The upper limit is especially conservative because it may include a
non-negligible contribution from the FRB host galaxies and a non-zero
contribution from the cosmic web. It strongly disfavors models where the Galaxy
has retained the majority of its baryons with a density profile tracking the
presumed dark matter density profile. Last, we perform Monte Carlo simulations
of larger FRB samples to validate our technique and assess the sensitivity of
ongoing and future surveys. We recover bounds of several tens $\text{pc
cm}^{-3}$ which may be sufficient to test whether the Galaxy has retained a
majority of its baryonic mass. We estimate that a sample of several thousand
FRBs will significantly tighten constraints on $\text{DM}_\text{MW,halo}$ and
offer a valuable complement to other analyses.

In this article we update constraints on superconducting cosmic strings
(SCSs) in light of the recent observational developments of fast radio bursts
(FRBs) astronomy. Assuming strings follow an exponential distribution
characterized by current, we show that two parameters in our context, which are
the characteristic tension ($G\mu$) and a parameter which describes the
aforementioned exponential distribution ($I_c$), can be constrained by FRB
experiments. Particularly, we investigate data sets from Parkes and ASKAP. We
looked through a parameter space where $G\mu \sim [10^{-17}, 10^{-12}]$ and
$I_c\sim [10^{-1}, 10^{2}]$ GeV, and found our results show that Parkes jointly
with ASKAP can constrain the parameter space for SCSs.

Electromagnetic precursor waves generated by the synchrotron maser
instability at relativistic magnetized shocks have been recently invoked to
explain the coherent radio emission of Fast Radio Bursts. By means of
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we explore the properties of the
precursor waves in relativistic electron-positron perpendicular shocks as a
function of the pre-shock magnetization $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., the ratio of
incoming Poynting flux to particle energy flux) and thermal spread $\Delta
\gamma \equiv kT/mc^2=10^{-5}-10^{-1}$. We measure the fraction $f_\xi$ of
total incoming energy that is converted into precursor waves, as computed in
the post-shock frame. At fixed magnetization, we find that $f_{\xi}$ is nearly
independent of temperature as long as $\Delta \gamma \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$ (with
only a modest decrease of a factor of three from $\Delta\gamma =10^{-5}$ to
$\Delta\gamma =10^{-1.5}$), but it drops by nearly two orders of magnitude for
$\Delta \gamma \gtrsim 10^{-1}$. At fixed temperature, the scaling with
magnetization $f_\xi\sim 10^{-3}\,\sigma^{-1}$ is consistent with our earlier
one-dimensional results. For our reference $\sigma=1$, the power spectrum of
precursor waves is relatively broad (fractional width $\sim 1-3$) for cold
temperatures, whereas it shows pronounced line-like features with fractional
width $\sim 0.2$ for $10^{-3} \lesssim \Delta \gamma \lesssim 10^{-1.5} $. For
$\sigma\gtrsim 1$, the precursor waves are beamed within an angle $\simeq
\sigma^{-1/2}$ from the shock normal (as measured in the post-shock frame), as
required so they can outrun the shock. Our results can provide
physically-grounded inputs for FRB emission models based on maser emission from
relativistic shocks.

Recently, repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) with a period of $P_{\rm
FRB}=16.35\pm0.18$ days from FRB 180916.J0158+65 had been reported. It still
remains controversial how to give rise to such a periodicity of this FRB. In
this Letter, based on an assumption of a young pulsar surrounding by a debris
disk, we attempt to diagnose whether the Lense-Thirring precession of the disk
on the emitter can produce the observed periodicity. Our calculations indicate
that the Lense-Thirring effect of a tilted disk can result in a precession
period of 16 days for a mass inflow rate of $0.5-1.5\times10^{18}~\rm
g\,s^{-1}$, a spin period of 1-20 ms of the pulsar, and an extremely low
viscous parameter $\alpha=10^{-8}$ in the disk. The disk mass and the magnetic
field of the pulsar are also constrained to be $\sim10^{-3}~\rm M_{\odot}$ and
$< 2.5\times 10^{13}~\rm G$. In our model, a new born pulsar with normal
magnetic field and millisecond period would successively experience accretion
phase, propeller phase, and is visible as a strong radio source in the current
stage. The rotational energy of such a young NS can provide the observed radio
bursting luminosity for $400$ years.

We report on the detection of seven bursts from the periodically active,
repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 180916.J0158+65 in the 300-400-MHz
frequency range with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Emission in multiple
bursts is visible down to the bottom of the GBT band, suggesting that the
cutoff frequency (if it exists) for FRB emission is lower than 300 MHz.
Observations were conducted during predicted periods of activity of the source,
and had simultaneous coverage with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the FRB
backend on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
telescope. We find that one of the GBT-detected bursts has potentially
associated emission in the CHIME band (400-800 MHz) but we detect no bursts in
the LOFAR band (110-190 MHz), placing a limit of $\alpha > -1.0$ on the
spectral index of broadband emission from the source. We also find that
emission from the source is severely band-limited with burst bandwidths as low
as $\sim$40 MHz. In addition, we place the strictest constraint on observable
scattering of the source, $<$ 1.7 ms, at 350 MHz, suggesting that the
circumburst environment does not have strong scattering properties.
Additionally, knowing that the circumburst environment is optically thin to
free-free absorption at 300 MHz, we find evidence against the association of a
hyper-compact HII region or a young supernova remnant (age $<$ 50 yr) with the
source.

The nearly 100% linear polarization has been reported for a few fast radio
bursts. This finding places severe limits on the emission mechanism. I argue
that the totally polarized radiation could be generated in the course of
relativistic magnetic reconnection in the outer magnetosphere of the magnetar.
At the onset of the magnetar flare, a large scale magnetic perturbation forms a
magnetic pulse, which propagates from the flare cite outwards. The pulse
strongly compresses magnetospheric plasma and pushes it away. The
high-frequency MHD waves are generated when the magnetic pulse reaches the
current sheet separating, just beyond the light cylinder, the oppositely
directed magnetic fields. Coalescence of magnetic islands in the reconnecting
current sheet produces magnetosonic waves, which propagate away on the top of
the magnetic pulse and escape in the far zone of the wind as radio waves
polarized along the rotational axis of the magnetar. I estimate parameters of
the outgoing radiation and show that they are compatible with the observed
properties of FRBs.

More than three quarters of the baryonic content of the Universe resides in a
highly diffuse state that is difficult to observe, with only a small fraction
directly observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Censuses of the nearby
Universe have used absorption line spectroscopy to observe these invisible
baryons, but these measurements rely on large and uncertain corrections and are
insensitive to the majority of the volume, and likely mass. Specifically,
quasar spectroscopy is sensitive either to only the very trace amounts of
Hydrogen that exists in the atomic state, or highly ionized and enriched gas in
denser regions near galaxies. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich analyses provide evidence of
some of the gas in filamentary structures and studies of X-ray emission are
most sensitive to gas near galaxy clusters. Here we report the direct
measurement of the baryon content of the Universe using the dispersion of a
sample of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), thus utilizing an effect that
measures the electron column density along each sight line and accounts for
every ionised baryon. We augment the sample of published arcsecond-localized
FRBs with a further four new localizations to host galaxies which have measured
redshifts of 0.291, 0.118, 0.378 and 0.522, completing a sample sufficiently
large to account for dispersion variations along the line of sight and in the
host galaxy environment to derive a cosmic baryon density of $\Omega_{b} =
0.051_{-0.025}^{+0.021} \, h_{70}^{-1}$ (95% confidence). This independent
measurement is consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis values.

The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope has started to localize Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs) to arcsecond accuracy from the detection of a single pulse,
allowing their host galaxies to be reliably identified. We discuss the global
properties of the host galaxies of the first four FRBs localized by ASKAP,
which lie in the redshift range $0.11<z<0.48$. All four are massive galaxies
(log( $M_{*}/ M_{\odot}$) $\sim 9.4 -10.4$) with modest star-formation rates of
up to $2M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ -- very different to the host galaxy of the first
repeating FRB 121102, which is a dwarf galaxy with a high specific
star-formation rate. The FRBs localized by ASKAP typically lie in the outskirts
of their host galaxies, which appears to rule out FRB progenitor models that
invoke active galactic nuclei (AGN) or free-floating cosmic strings. The
stellar population seen in these host galaxies also disfavors models in which
all FRBs arise from young magnetars produced by superluminous supernovae
(SLSNe), as proposed for the progenitor of FRB 121102. A range of other
progenitor models (including compact-object mergers and magnetars arising from
normal core-collapse supernovae) remain plausible.

Dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are commonly used as a
indicator of distance assuming that DM in excess of the expected amount within
the Milky Way in the direction of each FRB arise mostly from the inter-galactic
medium. However, the assumption might not be true if, for example, most FRB
progenitors are embedded in ionized circumstellar material (CSM, e.g. supernova
remnant). In this study, we jointly analyze distributions of DM, flux density,
and fluence of the FRB samples observed by the Parkes telescope and the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) using analytical models of
FRBs, to constrain fractions of various DM components that shape the overall DM
distribution and emission properties of FRBs. Comparing the model predictions
with the observations we find that the typical amount of DM in each FRB host
galaxy is $\sim 120$ cm$^{-3}$pc which is naturally explained as a combination
of interstellar medium (ISM) and halo of an ordinary galaxy, without additional
contribution from ionized CSM that is directly associated with an FRB
progenitor. Furthermore, we also find that observed flux densities of FRBs do
not statistically suffer strong $K$-correction, i.e. the typical luminosity
density of FRBs does not significantly change within the range of emitting
frequency $\nu_{\rm rest} \sim$ 1--4 GHz.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond
duration at cosmological distances. Since compact dark matter/objects (COs)
could act as lenses and cause split of this kind of very short duration
signals, Mu$\rm{\tilde{n}}$oz et al. (2016) has proposed a novel method to
probe COs with lensing of FRBs. In this Letter, we for the first time apply
this method to real data and give constraints of the nature of COs with
currently available FRB observations. We emphasize the information from dynamic
spectra of FRBs is quite necessary for identifying any lensed signals and find
no echoes in the existing data. The null search gives a constraint comparable
to that from galactic wide binaries, though the methods of redshift inference
from dispersion measure would impact a little. Furthermore, we make an improved
forecast basing on the distributions of real data for the ongoing and upcoming
telescopes. Finally, we discuss the situation where one or more lensed signals
will be detected. In such a case, the parameter space of COs can be pinned down
very well since the lens mass can be directly determined through the observed
flux ratio and time delay between split images.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short (millisecond) radio pulses originating
from enigmatic sources at extragalactic distances so far lacking a detection in
other energy bands. Magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) have been considered
as the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection is controversial because
of differing energetics and the lack of radio and X-ray detections with similar
characteristics in the two classes. We report here the detection by the AGILE
satellite on April 28, 2020 of an X-ray burst in coincidence with the very
bright radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst detected
by AGILE in the hard X-ray band (18-60 keV) lasts about 0.5 seconds, it is
spectrally cutoff above 80 keV, and implies an isotropically emitted energy ~
$10^{40}$ erg. This event is remarkable in many ways: it shows for the first
time that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like
radio bursts; it also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars may emit
X-ray bursts of both magnetospheric and radio-pulse types that may be
discovered in nearby sources. Guided by this detection, we discuss SGR
1935+2154 in the context of FRBs, and especially focus on the class of
repeating-FRBs. Based on energetics, magnetars with fields B ~ $10^{15}$ G may
power the majority of repeating-FRBs. Nearby repeating-FRBs offer a unique
occasion to consolidate the FRB-magnetar connection, and we present new data on
the X-ray monitoring of nearby FRBs. Our detection enlightens and constrains
the physical process leading to FRBs: contrary to previous expectations,
high-brightness temperature radio emission coexists with spectrally-cutoff
X-ray radiation.

The discovery rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is increasing dramatically
thanks to new radio facilities. Meanwhile, wide-field instruments such as the
47 deg$^2$ Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey the optical sky to study
transient and variable sources. We present serendipitous ZTF observations of
the CHIME repeating source FRB 180916.J0158+65, that was localized to a spiral
galaxy 149 Mpc away and is the first FRB suggesting periodic modulation in its
activity. While 147 ZTF exposures corresponded to expected high-activity
periods of this FRB, no single ZTF exposure was at the same time as a CHIME
detection. No $>3\sigma$ optical source was found at the FRB location in 683
ZTF exposures, totalling 5.69 hours of integration time. We combined ZTF upper
limits and expected repetitions from FRB 180916.J0158+65 in a statistical
framework using a Weibull distribution, agnostic of periodic modulation priors.
The analysis yielded a constraint on the ratio between the optical and radio
fluences of $\eta \lesssim 200$, corresponding to an optical energy $E_{\rm
opt} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{46}$ erg for a fiducial 10 Jy ms FRB (90%
confidence). A deeper (but less statistically robust) constraint of $\eta
\lesssim 3$ can be placed assuming a rate of $r(>5$ Jy ms)= hr$^{-1}$ and
$1.2\pm 1.1$ FRB occurring during exposures taken in high-activity windows. The
constraint can be improved with shorter per-image exposures and longer
integration time, or observing FRBs at higher Galactic latitudes. This work
demonstrated how current surveys can statistically constrain multi-wavelength
counterparts to FRBs even without deliberately scheduled simultaneous radio
observation.

Since their discovery in 2007, much effort has been devoted to uncovering the
sources of the extragalactic, millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs). A
class of neutron star known as magnetars is a leading candidate source of FRBs.
Magnetars have surface magnetic fields in excess of $10^{14}$ G, the decay of
which powers a range of high-energy phenomena. Here we present the discovery of
a millisecond-duration radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154,
with a fluence of $1.5\pm 0.3$ Mega-Jansky milliseconds. This event, termed ST
200428A(=FRB 200428), was detected on 28 April 2020 by the STARE2 radio array
in the 1281--1468\,MHz band. The isotropic-equivalent energy released in ST
200428A is $4\times10^{3}$ times greater than in any Galactic radio burst
previously observed on similar timescales. ST 200428A is just 40 times less
energetic than the weakest extragalactic FRB observed to date, and is arguably
drawn from the same population as the observed FRB sample. The coincidence of
ST 200428A with an X-ray burst favours emission models developed for FRBs that
describe synchrotron masers or electromagnetic pulses powered by magnetar
bursts and giant flares. The discovery of ST 200428A implies that active
magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 can produce FRBs at extragalactic distances. The
high volumetric rate of events like ST 200428A motivates dedicated searches for
similar bursts from nearby galaxies.

Magnetars are young, rotating neutron stars that possess larger magnetic
fields ($B$ $\approx$ $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ G) and longer rotational periods ($P$
$\approx$ 1-12 s) than ordinary pulsars. In contrast to rotation-powered
pulsars, magnetar emission is thought to be fueled by the evolution and decay
of their powerful magnetic fields. They display highly variable radio and X-ray
emission, but the processes responsible for this behavior remain a mystery. We
report the discovery of bright, persistent individual X-ray pulses from XTE
J1810-197, a transient radio magnetar, using the Neutron star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) following its recent radio reactivation. Similar
behavior has only been previously observed from a magnetar during short time
periods following a giant flare. However, the X-ray pulses presented here were
detected outside of a flaring state. They are less energetic and display
temporal structure that differs from the impulsive X-ray events previously
observed from the magnetar class, such as giant flares and short X-ray bursts.
Our high frequency radio observations of the magnetar, carried out
simultaneously with the X-ray observations, demonstrate that the relative
alignment between the X-ray and radio pulses varies on rotational timescales.
No correlation was found between the amplitudes or temporal structure of the
X-ray and radio pulses. The magnetar's 8.3 GHz radio pulses displayed frequency
structure, which was not observed in the pulses detected simultaneously at 31.9
GHz. Many of the radio pulses were also not detected simultaneously at both
frequencies, which indicates that the underlying emission mechanism producing
these pulses is not broadband. We find that the radio pulses from XTE J1810-197
share similar characteristics to radio bursts detected from fast radio burst
(FRB) sources, some of which are now thought to be produced by active
magnetars.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05283v2
A luminous radio burst was recently detected in temporal coincidence with a
hard X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 with a time and
frequency structure consistent with cosmological fast radio bursts (FRB) and a
fluence within a factor of $\lesssim 10$ of the least energetic extragalactic
FRB previously detected. Although active magnetars are commonly invoked FRB
sources, several distinct mechanisms have been proposed for generating the
radio emission which make different predictions for the accompanying higher
frequency radiation. We show that the properties of the coincident radio and
X-ray flares from SGR 1935+2154, including their approximate simultaneity and
relative fluence $E_{\rm radio}/E_{\rm X} \sim 10^{-5}$, as well as the
duration and spectrum of the X-ray emission, are consistent with extant
predictions for the synchrotron maser shock model. Rather than arising from the
inner magnetosphere, the X-rays are generated by (incoherent) synchrotron
radiation from thermal electrons heated at the same shocks which produce the
coherent maser emission. Although the rate of SGR 1935+2154-like bursts in the
local universe is not sufficient to contribute appreciably to the extragalactic
FRB rate, the inclusion of an additional population of more active magnetars
with stronger magnetic fields than the Galactic population can explain both the
FRB rate as well as the repeating fraction, however only if the population of
active magnetars are born at a rate that is at least two-orders of magnitude
lower than that of SGR 1935+2154-like magnetars. This may imply that the more
active magnetar sources are not younger magnetars formed in a similar way to
the Milky Way population (e.g. via ordinary supernovae), but instead through
more exotic channels such as superluminous supernovae, accretion-induced
collapse or neutron star mergers.

Fast radio bursts (FRB) probe the electron density of the universe along the
path of propagation, making high redshift FRB sensitive to the helium
reionization epoch. We analyze the signal to noise with which a detection of
the amplitude of reionization can be made, and its redshift, for various cases
of future FRB survey samples, assessing survey characteristics including total
number, redshift distribution, peak redshift, redshift depth, and number above
the reionization redshift, as well as dependence on reionization redshift. We
take into account scatter in the dispersion measure due to an inhomogeneous
intergalactic medium (IGM) and uncertainty in the FRB host and environment
dispersion measure, as well as cosmology. For a future survey with 500 FRB
extending out to $z=5$, and a sudden reionization, the detection of helium
reionization can approach the $5\sigma$ level and the reionization redshift be
determined to $\sigma(z_r)\approx0.24$ in an optimistic scenario, or $2\sigma$
and $\sigma(z_r)\approx0.34$ taking into account further uncertainties on IGM
fraction evolution and redshift uncertainties.

The discovery of a persistent radio source coincident with the first
repeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102, and offset from the center of its dwarf
host galaxy has been used as evidence for a link with young millisecond
magnetars born in superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (LGRBs). A prediction of this scenario is that compact radio sources
offset from the centers of dwarf galaxies may serve as signposts for at least
some FRBs. Recently, Reines et al. 2019 presented the discovery of 20 such
radio sources in nearby ($z\lesssim 0.055$) dwarf galaxies, and argued that
these cannot be explained by emission from HII regions, normal supernova
remnants, or normal radio supernovae. Instead, they attribute the emission to
accreting wandering massive black holes. Here, we explore the alternative
possibility that these sources are analogs of FRB 121102. We compare their
properties -- radio luminosities, spectral energy distributions, light curves,
ratios of radio-to-optical flux, and spatial offsets -- to FRB 121102, a few
other well-localized FRBs, and potentially related systems, and find that these
are all consistent as arising from the same population. We further compare
their properties to the magnetar nebula model used to explain FRB 121102, as
well as to theoretical off-axis LGRB light curves, and find overall
consistency. Finally, we find a consistent occurrence rate relative to
repeating FRBs and LGRBs. We outline key follow-up observations to further test
these possible connections.

Lyutikov (2002) predicted "radio emission from soft gamma-ray repeaters
(SGRs) during their bursting activity". Detection of a Mega-Jansky radio burst
in temporal coincidence with high energy bursts from a Galactic magnetar SGR
1935+2154 confirms that prediction. Similarity of this radio event with Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs) suggests that FRBs are produced within magnetar
magnetospheres. We demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 satisfies the previously
derived constraints on the physical parameters at the FRBs' loci. Coherent
radio emission is generated in the inner parts of the magnetosphere at $r< 100
R_{\rm NS}$. The radio emission is produced by the yet unidentified plasma
emission process, occurring during the initial stages of reconnection events.

Does the Galaxy contain sources of micro-FRB, lower energy events resembling
the known FRB but detectable only at Galactic distances? The answer to this
question is essential to determining the nature of FRB sources. At typical
($10$ kpc) Galactic distances a burst would be about 117 dB brighter than at a
"cosmological" ($z = 1$) distance. The radiation of Galactic micro-FRB, if they
exist, could be detected after Lunar reflection, or an upper bound on their
rate set, by a modest (20 m at 1.4 GHz) radio telescope staring at the Moon. It
would have all-sky sensitivity. The delay between detection of direct (by
STARE2 or dipoles) and Lunar-scattered radiation would restrict a burst's
position to a narrow arc.

Fast radio bursts can be caused by some phenomena related to 'new
physics'.One of the most prominent candidates of the kind are axion Bose stars
which can engender bursts when undergoing conversion into photons in
magnetospheres of neutron stars or during their collapse. In this short
research note an importance of three observational criteria is outlined, namely
total energetic, $\mathcal{O}$(ms) duration and non-monochromatic shape of the
spectrum. It is shown that it is impossible to meet these criteria in
simplified models of axion-neutron star interaction scenario and thorough
investigation of more complex models which involve back-reaction and non-linear
effects are needed in order to explain FRBs within this scenario.

The CHIME/FRB collaboration recently reported the detection of a 16 day
periodicity in the arrival times of radio bursts from FRB 180916.J0158+65. We
study the possibility that the observed periodicity arises from free precession
of a magnetized neutron star, and put constraints on different components of
the star's magnetic fields. Using a simple geometric model, where radio bursts
are emitted from a rotating neutron star magnetosphere, we show that the
emission pattern as a function of time can match that observed from FRB
180916.J0158+65.

We introduce a new capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, to
provide event data from the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on demand in response
to transients detected by other instruments. These event data are not
continuously available due to the large telemetry load, but are critical to
recovering weak or sub-threshold GRBs that are not triggered onboard, such as
the likely counterparts to GW-detected off-axis binary neutron star mergers. We
show that the availability of event data can effectively increase the rate of
detections, and arcminute localizations, of GRB 170817-like bursts by >400%. We
describe a spacecraft commanding pipeline purpose built to enable this science;
to our knowledge the first fully autonomous extremely-low-latency commanding of
a space telescope for scientific purposes. This pipeline has been successfully
run in its complete form since early 2020, and has resulted in the recovery of
BAT event data for >700 externally triggered events to date (GWs, neutrinos,
GRBs triggered by other facilities, FRBs), now running with a success rate of
~90%. We exemplify the utility of this new capability by using the resultant
data to (1) set the most sensitive (8 sigma) upper limits of $8.1\times10^{-8}$
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (14-195 keV) on prompt 1s duration short GRB-like
emission within $\pm$ 15s of the unmodelled GW burst candidate S200114f, and
(2) provide arcminute localizations for short GRB 200325A and other bursts. We
show that using data from GUANO to localize GRBs discovered elsewhere, we can
increase the net rate of arcminute localized GRBs by 10-20% per year. Along
with the scientific yield of more sensitive searches for sub-threshold GRBs,
the new capabilities designed for this project will enable further rapid
response Target of Opportunity capabilities for Swift, and have implications
for the design of future rapid-response space telescopes.

The periodic activity of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 180916.J0158+65 was
recently reported by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration team. 28 bursts from this
source not only show a $\sim16$-day period with an active phase of $\sim 4.0$
days but also exhibit a broken power law in differential energy distribution.
In this paper, we suggest that FRB 180916.J0158+65-like periodic FRBs would
provide a unique probe of extragalactic asteroid belts (EABs), based on our
previously-proposed pulsar-EAB impact model, in which repeating FRBs arise from
an old-aged, slowly-spinning, moderately-magnetized pulsar traveling through an
EAB around another stellar-mass object. These two objects form a binary and
thus the observed period is in fact the orbital period. We show that this model
can be used to well interpret all of the observed data of FRB 180916.J0158+65.
Furthermore, we constrain the EAB's physical properties and find that (1) the
outer radius of the EAB is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of
its analogue in the solar system, (2) the differential size distribution of the
EAB's asteroids at small diameters (large diameters) is shallower (steeper)
than that of solar-system small objects, and (3) the two belts have a
comparable mass.

The discovery that at least some Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) repeat has ruled
out cataclysmic events as the progenitors of these particular bursts.
FRB~121102 is the most well-studied repeating FRB but despite extensive
monitoring of the source, no underlying pattern in the repetition has
previously been identified. Here, we present the results from a radio
monitoring campaign of FRB~121102 using the 76-m Lovell telescope. Using the
pulses detected in the Lovell data along with pulses from the literature, we
report a detection of periodic behaviour of the source over the span of five
years of data. We predict that the source is currently `off' and that it should
turn `on' for the approximate MJD range $59002-59089$ (2020-06-02 to
2020-08-28). This result, along with the recent detection of periodicity from
another repeating FRB, highlights the need for long-term monitoring of
repeating FRBs at a high cadence. Using simulations, we show that one needs at
least 100 hours of telescope time to follow-up repeating FRBs at a cadence of
0.5--3 days to detect periodicities in the range of 10--150 days. If the period
is real, it shows that repeating FRBs can have a large range in their activity
periods that might be difficult to reconcile with neutron star precession
models.

We report the discovery of a highly dispersed fast radio burst, FRB~181123,
from an analysis of $\sim$1500~hr of drift-scan survey data taken using the
Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The pulse has
three distinct emission components, which vary with frequency across our
1.0--1.5~GHz observing band. We measure the peak flux density to be $>0.065$~Jy
and the corresponding fluence $>0.2$~Jy~ms. Based on the observed dispersion
measure of 1812~cm$^{-3}$~pc, we infer a redshift of $\sim 1.9$. From this, we
estimate the peak luminosity and isotropic energy to be $\lesssim
2\times10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 2\times10^{40}$~erg, respectively.
With only one FRB from the survey detected so far, our constraints on the event
rate are limited. We derive a 95\% confidence lower limit for the event rate of
900 FRBs per day for FRBs with fluences $>0.025$~Jy~ms. We performed follow-up
observations of the source with FAST for four hours and have not found a
repeated burst. We discuss the implications of this discovery for our
understanding of the physical mechanisms of FRBs.

We revisit the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) process, in which a white
dwarf collapses into a neutron star. We are motivated by the persistent radio
source associated with the fast radio burst FRB 121102, which was explained by
Waxman as a weak stellar explosion with a small ($\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$)
mildly relativistic mass ejection that may be consistent with AIC.
Additionally, the interaction of the relatively low ejected mass with a
pre-collapse wind might be related to fast optical transients. The AIC is
simulated with a one-dimensional, Lagrangian, Newtonian hydrodynamic code. We
put an emphasis on accurately treating the equation of state and the nuclear
burning, which is required for any study that attempts to accurately simulate
AIC. We leave subjects such as neutrino physics and general relativity
corrections for future work. Using an existing initial profile and our own
initial profiles, we find that the ejected mass is $\sim 10^{-2}$ to
$10^{-1}M_{\odot}$ over a wide range of parameters, and we construct a simple
model to explain our results.

The Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is directly related to the expansion of our
Universe. It can be used to study dark energy and constrain cosmology models.
In this paper, we propose that $H(z)$ can be measured using fast radio bursts
(FRBs) with redshift measurements. We use dispersion measures contributed by
the intergalactic medium, which is related to $H(z)$, to measure Hubble
parameter. We find that 500 mocked FRBs with dispersion measures and redshift
information can accurately measure Hubble parameters using Monte Carlo
simulation. The maximum deviation of $H(z)$ from standard $\Lambda$CDM model is
about 6\% at redshift $z= 2.4$. We also test our method using Monte Carlo
simulation. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is used to check the simulation. The
$p$-value of K-S test is 0.23, which confirms internal consistency of the
simulation. In future, more localizations of FRBs make it as an attractive
cosmological probe.

The first repeating fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 121102, was found to be
associated with a spatially coincident, persistent nonthermal radio source, but
the origin of the persistent emission remains unknown. In this paper, we
propose that the persistent emission is produced via synchrotron-heating
process by multiple bursts of FRB 121102 in a self-absorbed synchrotron nebula.
As a population of bursts of the repeating FRB absorbed by the synchrotron
nebula, the energy distribution of electrons in the nebula will change
significantly. As a result, the spectrum of the nebula will show a hump
steadily. For the persistent emission of FRB 121102, the total energy of bursts
injecting into the nebula is required to be about
$3.3\times10^{49}\,\unit{erg}$, the burst injection age is over $6.7\times
10^4\,\unit{yr}$, the nebula size is $\sim0.02\,\unit{pc}$, and the electron
number is about $3.2\times10^{55}$. We predict that as more bursts inject, the
brightness of the nebula would be brighter than the current observation, and
meanwhile, the peak frequency would become higher. Due to the synchrotron
absorption of the nebula, some low-frequency bursts would be absorbed, which
may explain why most bursts were detected above $\sim1~\unit{GHz}$.

The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is unknown. Young magnetars
born from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been suggested to be a possible central
engine of FRBs. We test such a hypothesis by systematically searching for
GRB-FRB spatial associations from 110 FRBs and 1440 GRBs. We find that one FRB
event, FRB 171209, discovered by the Parkes telescope is spatially coincident
with a historical long-duration GRB 110715A at $z=0.82$. The afterglow of GRB
110715A is consistent with being powered by a millisecond magnetar. The
extragalactic dispersion measure of FRB 171209 is in excess of that contributed
by the intergalactic medium, which can be interpreted as being contributed by a
young supernova remnant associated with the GRB. Overall, the significance of
the association is $(2.28 - 2.55) \sigma$. If the association is indeed
physical, our result suggests that the magnetars associated with long GRBs can
be the progenitors of at least some FRBs.

Recently, CHIME detected periodicity in the bursting rate of the repeating
FRB 180916.J0158+65. In a popular class of models, the fast radio bursts (FRBs)
are created by giant magnetic flares of a hyper-active magnetar driven by fast
ambipolar diffusion in the core. We point out that in this scenario the
magnetar is expected to precess freely with a period of hours to weeks. The
internal magnetic field $B\sim 10^{16}$G deforms the star, and magnetic flares
induce sudden changes in magnetic stresses. The resulting torques and
displacements of the principal axes of inertia are capable of pumping a
significant amplitude of precession. The anisotropy of the flaring FRB
activity, combined with precession, implies a strong periodic modulation of the
visible bursting rate. The ultra-strong field invoked in the magnetar model
provides: (1) energy for the frequent giant flares, (2) the high rate of
ambipolar diffusion, releasing the magnetic energy on the timescale $\sim
10^9$s, (3) the core temperature $T\approx 10^9$K, likely above the critical
temperature for neutron superfluidity, (4) strong magnetospheric torques, which
efficiently spin down the star, and (5) deformation with ellipticity $\epsilon>
10^{-6}$, much greater than the rotational deformation. These conditions result
in a precession with negligible viscous damping, and can explain the observed
16 day period in FRB 180916.J0158+65.

The engines that produce extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs), and the
mechanism by which the emission is generated, remain unknown. Many FRB models
predict prompt multi-wavelength counterparts, which can be used to refine our
knowledge of these fundamentals of the FRB phenomenon. However, several
previous targeted searches for prompt FRB counterparts have yielded no
detections, and have additionally not reached sufficient sensitivity with
respect to the predictions. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to
estimate the ratio, $\eta$, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at
various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission. Our technique combines
the fluence distribution of the FRB population with results from several
wide-field blind surveys for fast transients from the optical to the TeV bands.
We present constraints on $\eta$ that improve upon previous observations even
in the case that all unclassified transient events in existing surveys are FRB
counterparts. In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we
find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus
demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for $\eta$.
However, it is possible that FRB counterparts are lurking amongst catalogs of
unclassified transient events. Although our technique is robust to the present
uncertainty in the FRB fluence distribution, its ultimate application to
accurately estimate or bound $\eta$ will require the careful analysis of all
candidate fast-transient events in multi-wavelength survey data sets.

Two new fast single radio bursts FRB 180924 and FRB 190523 well localized to
massive galaxies have opened a new window to probe and characterize how cosmic
baryons are allocated between galaxies, their surroundings and intergalactic
medium. We are motivated by testing Einstein's weak equivalence principle with
these two cosmic transients which have accurate redshifts. Using photons with
different energies emitted by FRB 180924, we obtain, so far, the most stringent
bound $\Delta\gamma<2.16\times10^{-10}$ for non-repeating FRBs with accurate
redshifts when only considering the gravitational potential of the Milk Way. If
using the gravitational potential of the Laniakea supercluster instead of the
Milk Way one, we also obtain the strictest bound
$\Delta\gamma<1.06\times10^{-14}$ to date. In light of rapid progress of FRB
cosmology, towards the next two decades, we give an universal limitation
$\Delta\gamma<8.24\times10^{-22}$ from photons with different energies emitted
by single FRBs with accurate redshifts. Moreover, we analyze detailedly the
effects of various astrophysical parameters on the precision of weak
equivalence principle. We also estimate the abilities of single FRBs with known
redshifts to test the validity of swampland criterion, and to distinguish which
value of $H_0$ is preferred.

FRB 180916.J0158+65 has been found to repeatedly emit fast radio bursts with
the period in roughly 16 days. We propose that such periodicity comes from
orbit-induced, spin precession of the emitter, which is possibly a neutron
star. Depending on the mass of the companion, the binary period ranges from
several hundred to thousands of seconds. Such tight binaries have a relatively
short lifetime, which does not likely come from the gravitational decay of a
wide binary. We comment on the relation to GW190425 and the possibility in LISA
and LIGO detections.

The luminosity function of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), defined as the event
rate per unit cosmic co-moving volume per unit luminosity, may help to reveal
the possible origins of FRBs and design the optimal searching strategy. With
the Bayesian modelling, we measure the FRB luminosity function using 46 known
FRBs. Our Bayesian framework self-consistently models the selection effects,
including the survey sensitivity, the telescope beam response, and the electron
distributions from Milky Way / the host galaxy / local environment of FRBs.
Different from the previous companion paper, we pay attention to the FRB event
rate density and model the event counts of FRB surveys based on the Poisson
statistics. Assuming a Schechter luminosity function form, we infer (at the 95%
confidence level) that the characteristic FRB event rate density at the upper
cut-off luminosity $L^*=2.9_{-1.7}^{+11.9}\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$ is
$\phi^*=339_{-313}^{+1074}\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$, the power-law index is
$\alpha=-1.79_{-0.35}^{+0.31}$, and the lower cut-off luminosity is
$L_0\le9.1\times10^{41}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$. The event rate density of FRBs is
found to be $3.5_{-2.4}^{+5.7}\times10^4\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$ above
$10^{42}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$, $5.0_{-2.3}^{+3.2}\times10^3\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,
yr^{-1}$ above $10^{43}\,\rm erg\, s^{-1}$, and
$3.7_{-2.0}^{+3.5}\times10^2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}$ above $10^{44}\,\rm erg\,
s^{-1}$. As a result, we find that, for searches conducted at 1.4 GHz, the
optimal diameter of single-dish radio telescopes to detect FRBs is 30-40 m. The
possible astrophysical implications of the measured event rate density are also
discussed in the current paper.

We model the sample of fast radio bursts (FRB), including the newly
discovered CHIME repeaters, using the synchrotron blast wave model of Metzger,
Margalit & Sironi (2019). This model postulates that FRBs are precursor
radiation from ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks generated as flare ejecta
from a central engine collide with an effectively stationary external medium.
Downward drifting of the burst frequency structure naturally arises from
deceleration of the blast-wave. The data are consistent with FRBs being
produced by flares of energy $E_{\rm flare} \sim
10^{43}-10^{46}(f_{\xi}/10^{-3})^{-4/5}$ erg, where $f_{\xi}$ is the maser
efficiency, and minimum bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma \approx 10^2-10^3$, which
generate the observed FRBs at shock radii $r_{\rm sh} \sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ cm.
We infer upstream densities $n_{\rm ext}(r_{\rm sh}) \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$
cm$^{-3}$ and radial profiles $n_{\rm ext} \propto r^{-k}$ showing a range of
slopes $k \approx [-2,1]$ (which are seen to evolve between bursts), broadly
consistent with the upstream medium being the inner edge of an ion-loaded shell
released by a recent energetic flare. The burst timescales, energetics, rates,
and external medium properties are consistent with repeating FRBs arising from
young, hyper-active flaring magnetars, but the methodology presented is
generally applicable to any central engine which injects energy impulsively
into a dense magnetized medium. Uncertainties and variations of the model are
discussed, including the effects of the strong electric field of the FRB wave
(strength parameter $a \gg 1$) on the upstream medium. One-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized shocks into a pair plasma are
presented which demonstrate that high maser efficiency can be preserved, even
in the limit $a \gg 1$ in which the FRB wave accelerates the upstream electrons
to ultra-relativistic speeds.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a promising new probe for astronomy and
cosmology. Thanks to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, FRBs could be
used to study the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the cosmic expansion. It is
expected that numerous FRBs with identified redshifts will be available in the
near future through the identification of their host galaxies or counterparts.
$\rm DM_{IGM}$, the contribution from IGM to the observed dispersion measure
(DM) of FRB, carries the key information about IGM and the cosmic expansion
history. We can thus study the evolution of the universe by using FRBs with
identified redshifts. In the present work, we are interested in the fraction of
baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm IGM}$, which is useful to study the cosmic
expansion and the problem of the "missing baryons". We propose to reconstruct
the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift $z$ with FRBs via a
completely model-independent method, namely Gaussian processes. Since there is
not a large sample of FRBs with identified redshifts, we use simulated FRBs
instead. Through various simulations, we show that this methodology works well.

Five fast radio bursts (FRBs), including three apparently non-repeating ones
FRB 180924, FRB 181112, and FRB 190523, and two repeaters, FRB 121102 and FRB
180916.J0158+65, have already been localized so far. We apply a method
developed recently by us (Li et al. 2019) to these five localized FRBs to give
a cosmology-insensitive estimate of the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM,
$f_{\rm IGM}$. Using the measured dispersion measure (DM) and luminosity
distance $d_{\rm L}$ data (inferred from the FRB redshifts and $d_{\rm L}$ of
type Ia supernovae at the same redshifts) of the five FRBs, we constrain the
local $f_{\rm IGM} = 0.84^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$ with no evidence of redshift
dependence. This cosmology-insensitive estimate of $f_{\rm IGM}$ from FRB
observations is in excellent agreement with previous constraints using other
probes. Moreover, using the three apparently non-repeating FRBs only we get a
little looser but consistent result $f_{\rm IGM} = 0.74^{+0.24}_{-0.18}$. In
these two cases, reasonable estimations for the host galaxy DM contribution
(${\rm DM_{host}}$) can be achieved by modelling it as a function of star
formation rate. The constraints on both $f_{\rm IGM}$ and ${\rm DM_{host}}$ are
expected to be significantly improved with the rapid progress in localizing
FRBs.

We report on simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of the repeating fast
radio burst source FRB 180916.J0158+65 using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment (CHIME), Effelsberg, and Deep Space Network (DSS-14 and
DSS-63) radio telescopes and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. During 33 ks of
Chandra observations, we detect no radio bursts in overlapping Effelsberg or
Deep Space Network observations and a single radio burst during CHIME/FRB
source transits. We detect no X-ray events in excess of the background during
the Chandra observations. These non-detections imply a 5-$\sigma$ limit of
$<5\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for the 0.5--10 keV fluence of prompt emission
at the time of the radio burst and $1.3\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ at any time
during the Chandra observations at the position of FRB 180916.J0158+65. Given
the host-galaxy redshift of FRB 180916.J0158+65 ($z\sim0.034$), these
correspond to energy limits of $<1.6\times10^{45}$ erg and $<4\times10^{45}$
erg, respectively. We also place a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $<8\times10^{-15}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the 0.5--10\,keV absorbed flux of a persistent source at
the location of FRB 180916.J0158+65. This corresponds to a luminosity limit of
$<2\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using Fermi/GBM data we search for prompt
gamma-ray emission at the time of radio bursts from FRB 180916.J0158+65 and
find no significant bursts, placing a limit of $4\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
on the 10--100 keV fluence. We also search Fermi/LAT data for periodic
modulation of the gamma-ray brightness at the 16.35-day period of radio-burst
activity and detect no significant modulation. We compare these deep limits to
the predictions of various fast radio burst models, but conclude that similar
X-ray constraints on a closer fast radio burst source would be needed to
strongly constrain theory.

The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still unknown.
Multiwavelength and polarization observations of an FRB source would be helpful
to diagnose its progenitor and environment. So far only the first repeating
source FRB 121102 appears to be spatially coincident with a persistent radio
emission. Its bursts also have very large values of the Faraday rotation
measure (RM) i.e., $|{\rm RM}|\sim10^5~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$. We show that
theoretically there should be a simple relation between RM and the luminosity
of the persistent source of an FRB source if the observed RM mostly arises from
the persistent emission region. FRB 121102 follows this relation given that the
magnetic field in the persistent emission region is highly ordered and that the
number of relativistic electrons powering the persistent emission is comparable
to that of non-relativistic electrons that contribute to RM. The non-detections
of persistent emission sources from all other localized FRB sources are
consistent with their relatively small RMs ($\left|{\rm RM}\right|\lesssim{\rm
a~few}\times100~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$) according to this relation. Based on this
picture, the majority of FRBs without a large RM are not supposed to be
associated with bright persistent sources.

It is widely believed that magnetars could be born in core-collapse
supernovae (SNe), binary neutron star (BNS) or binary white dwarf (BWD)
mergers, or accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs. In this paper, we
investigate whether magnetars could also be produced from neutron star--white
dwarf (NSWD) mergers, motivated by FRB 180924-like fast radio bursts (FRBs)
possibly from magnetars born in BNS/BWD/AIC channels suggested by \cite{mar19}.
By a preliminary calculation, we find that NSWD mergers with unstable mass
transfer could result in the NS acquiring an ultra-strong magnetic field via
the dynamo mechanism due to differential rotation and convection or possibly
via the magnetic flux conservation scenario of a fossil field. If NSWD mergers
can indeed create magnetars, then such objects could produce at least a subset
of FRB 180924-like FRBs within the framework of flaring magnetars, since the
ejecta, local environments, and host galaxies of the final remnants from NSWD
mergers resemble those of BNS/BWD/AIC channels. This NSWD channel is also able
to well explain both the observational properties of FRB 180924-like and FRB
180916.J0158+65-like FRBs within a large range in local environments and host
galaxies.

FRB 180916 is a most intriguing source at 150 Mpc distance capable of
producing repeating fast radio bursts with a periodic 16.35 day temporal
pattern. We report on the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations of FRB 180916
obtained by AGILE and Swift. We focused on the recurrent 5-day time intervals
of active radio bursting and present results obtained on Feb. 3 - 8; Feb. 25;
Mar. 5 - 10; Mar. 22 - 28, 2020 during a multiwavelength campaign involving
high-energy and radio observations. We also searched for temporal coincidences
at millisecond timescales between all known radio bursts of FRB 180916 and
X-ray and MeV events detectable by AGILE. We do not detect any simultaneous
event or any extended X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission on timescales of
hours/days/weeks. Our cumulative X-ray (0.3-10 keV) flux upper limit of $5
\times\,10^{-14} \rm \, erg \, cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ (obtained during 5-day active
intervals) translates into an isotropic luminosity upper limit of $L_{X,UL}
\sim 1.5 \times\, 10^{41} \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Observations above 100 MeV over a
many-year timescale provide an average luminosity upper limit one order of
magnitude larger. These results provide the so-far most stringent limits on
high-energy emission from FRB 180916 and constrain the dissipation of magnetic
energy from a magnetar-like source of radius $R_m$, internal magnetic field
$B_m$ and dissipation timescale $\tau_d$ to satisfy the relation $R_{m,6}^3
B_{m,16}^2 \tau_{d,8}^{-1} \lesssim 1$, where $R_{m,6}$ is $R_m$ in units of
$10^6$ cm, $B_{m,16}$ is $B_m$ in units of $10^{16}$ G, and $\tau_{d,8}$ in
units of $10^8$ s.

FRB 121102, the first-known repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source, is
associated with a dwarf host galaxy and compact, persistent radio source. In an
effort to find other repeating FRBs, FIRST J141918.9+394036 (hereafter FIRST
J1419+3940) was identified in a search for similar persistent radio sources in
dwarf host galaxies. FIRST J1419+3940 was subsequently identified as a radio
transient decaying on timescales of decades, and it has been argued that it is
the orphan afterglow of a long gamma-ray burst. FIRST J1419+3940 and FRB
121102's persistent radio source show observational similarities, though the
latter appears to be stable in brightness. Nonetheless, if they have similar
physical origins, then FIRST J1419+3940 may also contain a source capable of
producing fast radio bursts. We report the non-detection of short-duration
radio bursts from FIRST J1419+3940 during 3.1 h of observations with the 110-m
Green Bank Telescope at both 2 and 6 GHz. FIRST J1419+3940 is 11 times closer
compared with FRB 121102, and exhibits an optically-thin synchrotron spectrum
above 1.4GHz; our search was thus sensitive to bursts more than 100 times
weaker than those seen from FRB 121102. We encourage future burst searches to
constrain the possible presence of an FRB-emitting source. Although such
searches are high-risk, any such detection could greatly elucidate the origins
of the FRB phenomenon.

We show that the periodic FRB 180916.J0158+65 can be interpreted by invoking
an interacting neutron star binary system with an orbital period of $\sim 16$
days. The FRBs are produced by a highly magnetized pulsar, whose magnetic field
is ``combed'' by the strong wind from a companion star, either a massive star
or a millisecond pulsar. The FRB pulsar wind retains a clear funnel in the
companion's wind that is otherwise opaque to induced Compton or Raman
scatterings for repeating FRB emission. The 4 day active window corresponds to
the time when the funnel points toward Earth. The interaction also perturbs the
magnetosphere of the FRB pulsar and may trigger emission of FRBs. We derive the
physical constraints on the comb and the FRB pulsar from the observations and
estimate the event rate of FRBs. In this scenario, a lower limit on the period
of observable FRBs is predicted. We speculate that both the intrinsic factors
(strong magnetic field and young age) and the extrinsic factor (interaction)
may be needed to generate FRBs in neutron star binary systems.

Understanding the evolution of the angle $\chi$ between a magnetar's rotation
and magnetic axes sheds light on the star's birth properties. This evolution is
coupled with that of the stellar rotation $\Omega$, and depends on the
competing effects of internal viscous dissipation and external torques. We
study this coupled evolution for a model magnetar with a strong internal
toroidal field, extending previous work by modelling -- for the first time in
this context -- the strong proto-magnetar wind acting shortly after birth. We
also account for the effect of buoyancy forces on viscous dissipation at late
times. Typically we find that $\chi\to 90^\circ$ shortly after birth, then
decreases towards $0^\circ$ over hundreds of years. From observational
indications that magnetars typically have small $\chi$, we infer that these
stars are subject to a stronger average exterior torque than radio pulsars, and
that they were born spinning faster than $\sim 100-300$ Hz. Our results allow
us to make quantitative predictions for the gravitational and electromagnetic
signals from a newborn rotating magnetar. We also comment briefly on the
possible connection with periodic Fast Radio Burst sources.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio bursts with a time scale of
approximately milliseconds. Two populations of FRB, namely repeating and
non-repeating FRBs, are observationally identified. However, the differences
between these two and their origins are still cloaked in mystery. Here we show
the time-integrated luminosity-duration ($L_{\nu}$-$w_{\rm int,rest}$)
relations and luminosity functions (LFs) of repeating and non-repeating FRBs in
the FRB Catalogue project. These two populations are obviously separated in the
$L_{\nu}$-$w_{\rm int,rest}$ plane with distinct LFs, i.e., repeating FRBs have
relatively fainter $L_{\nu}$ and longer $w_{\rm int,rest}$ with a much lower
LF. In contrast with non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs do not show any clear
correlation between $L_{\nu}$ and $w_{\rm int,rest}$. These results suggest
essentially different physical origins of the two. The faint ends of the LFs of
repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric occurrence rates of
neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, and
are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia
supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers. This indicates two
possibilities: either (i) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in neutron-star
mergers or AIC and are actually repeating during the lifetime of the
progenitor, or (ii) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in any of SGRs, type Ia
supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers. The bright ends of LFs of
repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates of progenitors,
suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the
progenitors regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in
unknown progenitors.

A large number of observations from the Parkes 64\,m-diameter radio
telescope, recorded with high time resolution, are publicly available. We have
re-processed all of the observations obtained during the first four years (from
1997 to 2001) of the Parkes Multibeam receiver system in order to identify
transient events and have built a database that records the 568,736,756 pulse
candidates generated during this search. We have discovered a new fast radio
burst (FRB), FRB~010305, with a dispersion measure of
350$\pm$5\,\,cm$^{-3}\,$pc and explored why so few FRBs have been discovered in
data prior to 2001. After accounting for the dispersion smearing across the
channel bandwidth and the sky regions surveyed, the number of FRBs is found to
be consistent with model predictions. We also present five single pulse
candidates from unknown sources, but with Galactic dispersion measures. We
extract a diverse range of sources from the database, which can be used, for
example, as a training set of data for new software being developed to search
for FRBs in the presence of radio frequency interference.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00645v1
We provide constraints on Fast Radio Burst (FRB) models by careful
considerations of radiation forces associated with these powerful transients.
We find that the induced-Compton scatterings of the coherent radiation by
electrons/positrons accelerate particles to very large Lorentz factors (LF) in
and around the source of this radiation. This severely restricts those models
for FRBs that invoke relativistic shocks and maser type instabilities at
distances less than about $10^{13}$ cm of the neutron star. Radiation traveling
upstream, in these models, forces particles to move away from the shock with a
LF larger than the LF of the shock front. This suspends the photon generation
process after it has been operating for less than ~0.1 ms (observer frame
duration). We show that masers operating in shocks at distances larger than
$10^{13}$ cm cannot simultaneously account for the burst duration of 1 ms or
more and the observed ~1 GHz frequencies of FRBs without requiring an excessive
energy budget ($10^{46}$ erg); the energy is not calculated by imposing any
efficiency consideration, or other details, for the maser mechanism, but is
entirely the result of ensuring that particle acceleration by induced-Compton
forces upstream of the shock front does not choke off the maser process. For
the source to operate more or less continuously for a few ms, it should be
embedded in a strong magnetic field - cyclotron frequency $\gg$ wave frequency
- so that radiation forces do not disperse the plasma and shut-off the engine.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00644v1
We present a model for FRBs where a large amplitude Alfven wave packet is
launched by a disturbance near the surface of a magnetar, and a substantial
fraction of the wave energy is converted to coherent radio waves at a distance
of a few tens of neutron star radii. The wave amplitude at the magnetar surface
should be about 1011G in order to produce a FRB of isotropic luminosity
10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. An electric current along the static magnetic field is
required by Alfven waves with nonzero component of transverse wave-vector. The
current is supplied by counter-streaming electron-positron pairs, which have to
move at nearly the speed of light at larger radii as the plasma density
decreases with distance from the magnetar surface. The counter-streaming pairs
are subject to two-stream instability which leads to the formation of particle
bunches of size of order $c/\omega_p$; where $\omega_p$ is plasma frequency. A
strong electric field develops along the static magnetic field when the wave
packet arrives at a radius where electron-positron density is insufficient to
supply the current required by the wave. The electric field accelerates
particle bunches along the curved magnetic field lines, and that produces the
coherent FRB radiation. We provide a number of predictions of this model.

We present the data analysis pipeline, commissioning observations and initial
results from the GREENBURST fast radio burst (FRB) detection system on the
Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) previously described by Surnis et al.
which uses the 21~cm receiver observing commensally with other projects. The
pipeline makes use of a state-of-the-art deep learning classifier to winnow
down the very large number of false positive single-pulse candidates that
mostly result from radio frequency interference. In our observations totalling
156.5 days so far, we have detected individual pulses from 20 known radio
pulsars which provide an excellent verification of the system performance. We
also demonstrate, through blind injection analyses, that our pipeline is
complete down to a signal-to-noise threshold of 12. Depending on the observing
mode, this translates to peak flux sensitivities in the range 0.14--0.89~Jy.
Although no FRBs have been detected to date, we have used our results to update
the analysis of Lawrence et al. to constrain the FRB all-sky rate to be
$1140^{+200}_{-180}$ per day above a peak flux density of 1~Jy. We also
constrain the source count index $\alpha=0.83\pm0.06$ which indicates that the
source count distribution is substantially flatter than expected from a
Euclidean distribution of standard candles (where $\alpha=1.5$). We discuss
this result in the context of the FRB redshift and luminosity distributions.
Finally, we make predictions for detection rates with GREENBURST, as well as
other ongoing and planned FRB experiments.

Magnetars younger than one century are expected to be hyper active. Besides
winds powered by rotation they generate frequent magnetic flares, which launch
powerful blast waves into the wind. These internal shocks act as masers
producing fast (millisecond) radio bursts (FRBs) with the following properties.
(1) GHz radio emission occurs at radii $r\sim 10^{14}$ cm and lasts $\lesssim
1$ ms in observer's time. (2) Induced scattering in the surrounding wind does
not suppress the radio burst. (3) The emission has linear polarization set by
the magnetar rotation axis. (4) The emission drifts to lower frequencies during
the burst, and its duration broadens at lower frequencies. (5) Blast waves in
inhomogeneous winds may emit variable bursts; periodicity might appear on
sub-ms timescales if the magnetar rotates with $\sim 1$ s period. However, the
observed FRB structure is likely changed by lensing effects during propagation
through the host galaxy. (6) The FRBs from magnetars are expected to repeat,
with rare strong bursts (up to $\sim 10^{43}$ erg) or more frequent weak
bursts. (7) When a repeating flare strikes the wind bubble in the tail of a
previous flare, the FRB turns into a bright optical flash. Its luminosity may
approach that of a supernova Ia and last seconds. The rate of these optical
flashes in the universe is much lower than the FRB rate, however it may exceed
the supernova rate. Locations of hyper-active magnetars in their host galaxies
depend on how they form: magnetars created in supernovae explosions will trace
star formation regions, and magnetars formed in mergers of compact objects will
be offset. The merger magnetars are expected to be most energetic and
particularly hyper-active.

We present a simple and fast method for incoherent dedispersion and fast
radio burst (FRB) detection based on the Hough transform, which is widely used
for feature extraction in image analysis. The Hough transform maps a point in
the time-frequency data to a straight line in the parameter space, and points
on the same dispersed $f^{-2}$ curve to a bundle of lines all crossing at the
same point, thus the curve is transformed to a single point in the parameter
space, enabling an easier way for the detection of radio burst. By choosing an
appropriate truncation threshold, in a reasonably radio quiet environment, i.e.
with radio frequency interferences (RFIs) present but not dominant, the
computing speed of the method is very fast. Using simulation data of different
noise levels, we studied how the detected peak varies with different truncation
thresholds. We also tested the method with some real pulsar and FRB data.

We present two searches for IceCube neutrino events coincident with 28 fast
radio bursts (FRBs) and one repeating FRB. The first improves upon a previous
IceCube analysis -- searching for spatial and temporal correlation of events
with FRBs at energies greater than roughly 50 GeV -- by increasing the
effective area by an order of magnitude. The second is a search for temporal
correlation of MeV neutrino events with FRBs. No significant correlation is
found in either search, therefore, we set upper limits on the time-integrated
neutrino flux emitted by FRBs for a range of emission timescales less than one
day. These are the first limits on FRB neutrino emission at the MeV scale, and
the limits set at higher energies are an order-of-magnitude improvement over
those set by any neutrino telescope.

No robust detection of prompt electromagnetic counterparts to fast radio
bursts (FRBs) has yet been obtained, in spite of several multi-wavelength
searches carried out so far. Specifically, X/gamma-ray counterparts are
predicted by some models. We planned on searching for prompt gamma-ray
counterparts in the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT)
data, taking advantage of the unique combination of large effective area in the
keV-MeV energy range and of sub-ms time resolution. We selected 39 FRBs that
were promptly visible from the High-Energy (HE) instrument aboard Insight-HXMT.
After calculating the expected arrival times at the location of the spacecraft,
we searched for a significant excess in both individual and cumulative time
profiles over a wide range of time resolutions, from several seconds down to
sub-ms scales. Using the dispersion measures in excess of the Galactic terms,
we estimated the upper limits on the redshifts. No convincing signal was found
and for each FRB we constrained the gamma-ray isotropic-equivalent luminosity
and the released energy as a function of emission timescale. For the nearest
FRB source, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, we find
$L_{\gamma,iso}<5.5\times 10^{47}$ erg/s over 1 s, whereas
$L_{\gamma,iso}<10^{49}-10^{51}$ erg/s for the bulk of FRBs. The same values
scale up by a factor of ~100 for a ms-long emission. Even on a timescale
comparable with that of the radio pulse itself no keV-MeV emission is observed.
A systematic association with either long or short GRBs is ruled out with high
confidence, except for subluminous events, as is the case for core-collapse of
massive stars (long) or binary neutron star mergers (short) viewed off axis.
Only giant flares from extra-galactic magnetars at least ten times more
energetic than Galactic siblings are ruled out for the nearest FRB.

A handful of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are now known to repeat. However, the
question remains --- do they all? We report on an extensive observational
campaign with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), Parkes,
and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, searching for repeat bursts from FRBs
detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey. In 383.2 hr
of follow-up observations covering 27 FRBs initially detected as single bursts,
only two repeat bursts from a single FRB, FRB 171019, were detected, which have
been previously reported by Kumar et al. We use simulations of repeating FRBs
that allow for clustering in burst arrival times to calculate new estimates for
the repetition rate of FRB 171019, finding only slight evidence for
incompatibility with the properties of FRB 121102. Our lack of repeat bursts
from the remaining FRBs set limits on the model of all bursts being
attributable to repeating FRBs. Assuming a reasonable range of repetition
behaviour, at most 60% (90% C.L.) of these FRBs having an intrinsic burst
distribution similar to FRB~121102. This result is shown to be robust against
different assumptions on the nature of repeating FRB behaviour, and indicates
that if indeed all FRBs repeat, the majority must do so very rarely.

While the radiation mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is unknown,
coherent curvature radiation and synchrotron maser are promising candidates. We
find that both radiation mechanisms work for a neutron star (NS) central engine
with $B\gtrsim 10^{12}$ G, while for the synchrotron maser, the central engine
can also be an accreting black hole (BH) with $B\gtrsim 10^{12}$ G and a white
dwarf (WD) with $B\sim 10^8-10^9$ G. We study the electromagnetic counterparts
associated with such central engines, i.e., nebulae for repeating FRBs and
afterglows for non-repeating FRBs. In general, the energy spectrum and flux
density of the counterpart depend strongly on its size and total injected
energy. We apply the calculation to the nebula of FRB 121102 and find that the
persistent radio counterpart requires the average energy injection rate into
the nebula to be between $2.7\times10^{39}~{\rm erg/s}$ and
$1.5\times10^{44}~{\rm erg/s}$, and the minimum injected energy be
$6.0\times10^{47}~{\rm erg}$ in around $7$ yr. Consequently, we find that for
FRB 121102 and its nebula: (1) WD and accretion BH central engines are
disfavored; (2) a rotation-powered NS central engine works when
$1.2\times10^{12}~{\rm G}\lesssim B\lesssim 7.8\times10^{14}~{\rm G}$ with
initial period $P<180$ ms, but the radio emission must be more efficient than
that in typical giant pulses of radio pulsars; and (3) a magnetic-powered NS
central engine works when its internal magnetic field $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G. We
also find that the radio-emitting electrons in the nebula could produce a
significant rotation measure (RM), but cannot account for the entire observed
RM of FRB 121102.

We propose that the periodic fast radio bursts of FRB 180916.J0158+65 are
sourced by axion emission (mass $m_{a} \sim 10^{-14}$ eV) from cosmic
superstrings. Some of the emitted axions are converted to photons by magnetic
fields as they travel along the line of sight to Earth. An impulsive burst of
axion emission generates a photon signal typically lasting for milliseconds and
varying with frequency in the observed manner. We find a range of parameters in
our cosmic string network model consistent with the properties of FRB
180916.J0158+65. We suggest followup gravitational wave observations to test
our model.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, short-duration radio transients with
very high brightness temperatures implying highly coherent emission. We suggest
that the FRBs are caused by the self-focusing of an electron beam interacting
with an ambient plasma right beyond the light cylinder radius of a neutron
star. The magnetic field at the light cylinder radius is relatively high which
can accommodate both young Crab-like systems and old millisecond pulsars
addressing the diverse environments of FRBs. At the first stage, the intense
pulsed-beam passing through the background plasma causes instabilities such
that the trapped particles in local Buneman-type cavitons saturate the local
field. The beam is then radially self-focused due to the circular electric
field developed by the two-stream instability which leads to Weibel instability
in the transverse direction. Finally, the non-linear saturation of the Weibel
instability results in the self-modulational formation of solitons due to
plasmoid instability. The resonant solitary waves are the breather-type
solitons hosting relativistic particles with self-excited oscillations. The
analytical solutions obtained for non-linear dispersion and solitons suggest
that, near the current sheets, the relativistic bunches are
accelerated/amplified by klystron-like structures due to self-excited
oscillations by the induced local electric field. Boosted coherent radio
emission propagates through a narrow cone with strong focusing due to radial
electric field and magnetic pinching. The non-linear evolution of solitons and
the stimulated emission are associated with the Buneman instability and the
possibility of the presence of nanosecond shots in FRBs are investigated.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic, bright pulses of emission at
radio frequency with milliseconds duration. Observationally, FRBs can be
divided into two classes, repeating FRBs and non-repeating FRBs. At present,
twenty repeating FRBs have been discovered with unknown physical origins.
Localization of the first repeating FRB 121102 and discovery of an associated
persistent radio source support that FRBs are powered by young millisecond
magnetars, which could be formed by core-collapses of massive stars or binary
neutron stars mergers. These two formation channels can be distinguished by
gravitational waves generated by binary neutron stars mergers. We first
calculate the lower limit of the local formation rate of repeating FRBs
observed by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) . Then
we show that only a small fraction ($6\%$) of repeating FRBs is produced by
young magnetars from binary neutron star mergers, basing on the gravitational
wave detections by the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO/Virgo
gravitational-wave detectors. Therefore, we believe that repeating FRBs are
more likely produced by the magnetars newborn from the core-collapses of
massive stars rather than the magnetars from the binary neutron stars mergers.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10758v2
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients whose physical
origin is still unknown. Within a few astronomical units near an FRB source,
the electric field of the electromagnetic wave is so large that the electron
oscillation velocity becomes relativistic, which makes the classical Thomson
scattering theory and the linear plasma theory invalid. We discuss FRBs as
strong waves interacting with the ambient medium, in terms of both electron
motion properties and plasma properties. Several novel features are identified.
1. The cross section of Thomson scattering is significantly enhanced for the
scattering photons. 2. On the other hand, because of the nonlinear plasma
properties in strong waves, the near-source plasma is more transparent and has
a smaller effective dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the observed value.
For a repeating FRB source, the brighter bursts would have somewhat smaller DMs
contributed by the near-source plasma. 3. The radiation beam undergoes
relativistic self-focusing in a dense plasma, the degree of self-focusing (or
squeezing) depends on the plasma density. Such a squeezing effect would affect
the collimation angle and the true event rate of FRBs. 4. When an FRB
propagates in a nearby ambient plasma, a wakefield wave in the plasma will be
generated by the ponderomotive force of the FRB and accelerates electrons in
the ambient medium. However, such an effect is too weak to be observationally
interesting.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03260v2
We discuss physical constrains that observations of high brightness
temperature coherent radio emission, with brightness temperatures as high as
$T_b \sim 10^{35}$ K, impose on the plasma parameters at relativistically
moving astrophysical sources. High brightness temperatures imply a minimal
plasma energy density at the source. Additional important constraints come from
the fact that resonantly emitting particles lose most of their energy to
non-resonant inverse Compton and synchrotron processes.
  We also interpret recent observations of high-to-low frequency drifting
features in the spectra of repeating FRBs as analogues of type-III Solar radio
bursts produced by reconnection plasma beams within magnetospheres of highly
magnetized neutron stars.

We have developed a new coherent dedispersion mode to study the emission of
Fast Radio Bursts that trigger the voltage capture capability of the Australian
SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) interferometer. In principle the mode can probe emission
timescales down to 3 ns with full polarimetric information preserved. Enabled
by the new capability, here we present a spectropolarimetric analysis of FRB
181112 detected by ASKAP, localized to a galaxy at redshift 0.47. At
microsecond time resolution the burst is resolved into four narrow pulses with
a rise time of just $15 \mu$s for the brightest. The pulses have a diversity of
morphology, but do not show evidence for temporal broadening by turbulent
plasma along the line of sight, nor is there any evidence for periodicity in
their arrival times. The pulses are highly polarized (up to 95%), with the
polarization position angle varying both between and within pulses. The pulses
have apparent rotation measures that vary by $15\pm 2\, {\rm rad \,m^{-2}}$ and
apparent dispersion measures that vary by $0.041\pm 0.004\,{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$.
Conversion between linear and circular polarization is observed across the
brightest pulse. We conclude that the FRB 181112 pulses are most consistent
with being a direct manifestation of the emission process or the result of
propagation through a relativistic plasma close to the source. This
demonstrates that our method, which facilitates high-time-resolution
polarimetric observations of FRBs, can be used to study not only burst emission
processes, but also a diversity of propagation effects present on the
gigaparsec paths they traverse.

In the literature, compact binary coalescences (CBCs) have been proposed as
one of the main scenarios to explain the origin of some non-repeating fast
radio bursts (FRBs). The large discrepancy between the FRB and CBC event rate
densities suggest their associations, if any, should only apply at most for a
small fraction of FRBs. Through a Bayesian estimation method, we show how a
statistical analysis of the coincident associations of FRBs with CBC
gravitational wave (GW) events may test the hypothesis of these associations.
We show that during the operation period of advanced LIGO, the detection of
$\sim100$ ($\sim1000$) GW-less FRBs with dispersion measure (DM) values smaller
than 500 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ could reach the constraint that less than $10\%$
(or $1\%$) FRBs are related to binary black hole (BBH) mergers. The same number
of FRBs with DM values smaller than 100 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ is required to reach
the same constraint for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. With the upgrade of
GW detectors, the same constraints for BBH and BNS mergers can be reached with
less FRBs or looser requirements for the DM values. It is also possible to pose
constraints on the fraction of each type of CBCs that are able to produce
observable FRBs based on the event density of FRBs and CBCs. This would further
constrain the dimensionless charge of black holes in binary BH systems.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright, extragalactic radio pulses whose origins
are still unknown. Until recently, most FRBs have been detected at frequencies
greater than 1 GHz with a few exceptions at 800 MHz. The recent discoveries of
FRBs at 400 MHz from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
telescope has opened up possibilities for new insights about the progenitors
while many other low frequency surveys in the past have failed to find any
FRBs. Here, we present results from a FRB survey recently conducted at the
Jodrell Bank Observatory at 332 MHz with the 76-m Lovell telescope for a total
of 58 days. We did not detect any FRBs in the survey and report a 90$\%$ upper
limit of 5500 FRBs per day per sky for a Euclidean Universe above a fluence
threshold of 46 Jy ms. We discuss the possibility of absorption as the main
cause of non-detections in low frequency (< 800 MHz) searches and invoke
different absorption models to explain the same. We find that Induced Compton
Scattering alone cannot account for absorption of radio emission and that our
simulations favour a combination of Induced Compton Scattering and Free-Free
Absorption to explain the non-detections. For a free-free absorption scenario,
our constraints on the electron density are consistent with those expected in
the post-shock region of the ionized ejecta in Super-Luminous SuperNovae
(SLSNe).

Popular models of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (and perhaps of all Fast Radio
Bursts) involve neutron stars because of their high rotational or magnetostatic
energy densities. These models take one of two forms: giant but rare
pulsar-like pulses like those of Rotating RAdio Transients and outbursts like
those of Soft Gamma Repeaters. Here I collate the evidence, recently
strengthened, against these models, including the absence of Galactic
micro-FRB, and attribute the 16 day periodicity of FRB 180916.J0158+65 to the
precession of a jet produced by a massive black hole's accretion disc.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00335v2
Recent observations of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggest that some
FRBs reside in an environment consistent with that of binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers. The bursting rate for repeaters could be very high and the emission
site is likely from a magnetosphere. We discuss a hypothesis of producing
abundant repeating FRBs in BNS systems. Decades to centuries before a BNS
system coalesces, the magnetospheres of the two neutron stars start to interact
relentlessly. Abrupt magnetic reconnection accelerates particles, which emit
coherent radio waves in bunches via curvature radiation. FRBs are detected as
these bright radiation beams point towards Earth. This model predicts
quasi-periodicity of the bursts at the rotation periods of the two merging
neutron stars (tens of milliseconds and seconds, respectively) as well as the
period of orbital motion (of the order of 100 s). The bursting activities are
expected to elevate with time as the two neutron stars get closer. The
repeating FRB sources should be gravitational wave (GW) sources for space-borne
detectors such as LISA if the sources are close enough, and will be eventually
detected by ground-based detectors when the two neutron stars coalesce.

We focus on two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) recently detected by the
CHIME/FRB experiment in 2018--2019 (Source 1: 180916.J0158+65, and Source 2:
181030.J1054+73). These sources have low excess dispersion measures (DMs) ($ <
100 \rm \, pc \, cm^{-3}$ and $ < 20 \rm \, pc \, cm^{-3}$, respectively),
implying relatively small maximal distances. They were repeatedly observed by
AGILE in the MeV--GeV energy range. We do not detect prompt emission
simultaneously with these repeating events. This search is particularly
significant for the submillisecond and millisecond integrations obtainable by
AGILE. The sources are constrained to emit a MeV-fluence in the millisecond
range below $F'_{MeV} = 10^{-8} \, \rm erg \, cm^{-2}$ corresponding to an
isotropic energy near $E_{MeV,UL} \simeq 2 \times 10^{46}\,$erg for a distance
of 150 Mpc (applicable to Source 1). We also searched for $\gamma$-ray emission
for time intervals up to 100 days, obtaining 3$\,\sigma$ upper limits (ULs) for
the average isotropic luminosity above 50 MeV, $L_{\gamma,UL} \simeq
\,$(5-10)$\,\times 10^{43} \rm \, erg \, s^{-1}$. For a source distance near
100 kpc (possibly applicable to Source 2), our ULs imply
$E_{MeV,UL}\simeq10^{40} \rm erg$, and $L_{\gamma,UL} \simeq \,$2$\,\times
10^{37} \rm \, erg \, s^{-1}$. Our results are significant in constraining the
high-energy emission of underlying sources such as magnetars, or other
phenomena related to extragalactic compact objects, and show the prompt
emission to be lower than the peak of the 2004 magnetar outburst of SGR 1806-20
for source distances less than about 100 Mpc.

An imaging technique with sensitivity to short duration optical transients is
described. The technique is based on the use of wide-field cameras operating in
a drift scanning mode, whereby persistent objects produce trails on the sensor
and short duration transients occupy localised groups of pixels. A benefit of
the technique is that sensitivity to short duration signals is not accompanied
by massive data rates, because the exposure time >> transient duration. The
technique is demonstrated using a pre-prototype system composed of readily
available and inexpensive commercial components, coupled with common coding
environments, commercially available software, and free web-based services. The
performance of the technique and the pre-prototype system is explored,
including aspects of photometric and astrometric calibration, detection
sensitivity, characterisation of candidate transients, and the differentiation
of astronomical signals from non-astronomical signals (primarily glints from
satellites in Earth orbit and cosmic ray hits on sensor pixels). Test
observations were made using the pre-prototype system, achieving sensitivity to
transients with 21 ms duration, resulting in the detection of five candidate
transients. An investigation of these candidates concludes they are most likely
due to cosmic ray hits on the sensor and/or satellites. The sensitivity
obtained with the pre-prototype system is such that, under some models for the
optical emission from FRBs, the detection of a typical FRB, such as FRB181228,
to a distance of approximately 100 Mpc is plausible. Several options for
improving the system/technique in the future are described.

Automatic detection of scene texts in the wild is a challenging problem,
particularly due to the difficulties in handling (i) occlusions of varying
percentages, (ii) widely different scales and orientations, (iii) severe
degradations in the image quality etc. In this article, we propose a fully
convolutional neural network architecture consisting of a novel Feature
Representation Block (FRB) capable of efficient abstraction of information. The
proposed network has been trained using curriculum learning with respect to
difficulties in image samples and gradual pixel-wise blurring. It is capable of
detecting texts of different scales and orientations suffered by blurring from
multiple possible sources, non-uniform illumination as well as partial
occlusions of varying percentages. Text detection performance of the proposed
framework on various benchmark sample databases including ICDAR 2015, ICDAR
2017 MLT, COCO-Text and MSRA-TD500 improves respective state-of-the-art results
significantly. Source code of the proposed architecture will be made available
at github.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances still hold concealed
physical origins. Previously Liu (2018) proposes a scenario that the collision
between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD) can be one of the
progenitors of non-repeating FRBs and notices that the repeating FRBs can also
be explained if a magnetar formed after such NS-WD merger. In this paper, we
investigate this channel of magnetar formation in more detail. We propose that
the NS-WD post-merger, after cooling and angular momentum redistribution, may
collapse to either a black hole or a new NS or even remains as a hybrid WDNS,
depending on the total mass of the NS and WD. In particular, the newly formed
NS can be a magnetar if the core of the WD collapsed into the NS while large
quantities of degenerate electrons of the WD compressed to the outer layers of
the new NS. A strong magnetic field can be formed by the electrons and positive
charges with different angular velocities induced by the differential rotation
of the newborn magnetar. Such a magnetar can power the repeating FRBs by the
magnetic reconnections due to the crustal movements or starquakes.

Young neutron stars (NSs) born in core-collapse explosions are promising
candidates for the central engines of fast radio bursts (FRBs), since the first
localized repeating burst FRB 121102 happens in a star forming dwarf galaxy,
which is similar to the host galaxies of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and
long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). However, FRB 180924 and FRB 190523 are localized
to massive galaxies with low rates of star formation, compared with the host of
FRB 121102. Meanwhile, the offsets between the bursts and host centers are
about 4 kpc and 29 kpc for FRB 180924 and FRB 190523, respectively. These
properties of hosts are similar to short gamma-ray bursts \textbf{(SGRBs)},
which are produced by mergers of binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron
star-black hole (NS-BH). Therefore, the NSs powering FRBs may be formed in BNS
mergers. In this paper, we study the BNS merger rates, merger times, and
predict their most likely merger locations for different types of host galaxies
using population synthesis method. We find that the BNS merger channel is
consistent with the recently reported offsets of FRB 180924 and FRB 190523. The
offset distribution of short GRBs is well reproduced by population synthesis
using galaxy model which is similar to GRB hosts. The event rate of FRBs
(including non-repeating and repeating), is larger than those of BNS merger and
short GRBs, which requires a large fraction of observed FRBs emitting several
bursts. Using curvature radiation by bunches in NS magnetospheres, we also
predict the observational properties of FRBs from BNS mergers, including the
dispersion measure, and rotation measure. At late times ($t\geq1$yr), the
contribution to dispersion measure and rotation measure from BNS merger ejecta
could be neglected.

We report on the discovery and analysis of bursts from nine new repeating
fast radio burst (FRB) sources found using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. These sources span a dispersion measure
(DM) range of 195 to 1380 pc cm$^{-3}$. We detect two bursts from three of the
new sources, three bursts from four of the new sources, four bursts from one
new source, and five bursts from one new source. We determine sky coordinates
of all sources with uncertainties of $\sim$10$^\prime$. We detect Faraday
rotation measures for two sources, with values $-20(1)$ and $-499.8(7)$ rad
m$^{-2}$, that are substantially lower than the RM derived from bursts emitted
by FRB 121102. We find that the DM distribution of our events, combined with
the nine other repeaters discovered by CHIME/FRB, is indistinguishable from
that of thus far non-repeating CHIME/FRB events. However, as previously
reported, the burst widths appear statistically significantly larger than the
thus far non-repeating CHIME/FRB events, further supporting the notion of
inherently different emission mechanisms and/or local environments. These
results are consistent with previous work, though are now derived from 18
repeating sources discovered by CHIME/FRB during its first year of operation.
We identify candidate galaxies that may contain FRB 190303.J1353+48 (DM = 222.4
pc cm$^{-3}$).

Repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) present excellent opportunities to
identify FRB progenitors and host environments, as well as decipher the
underlying emission mechanism. Detailed studies of repeating FRBs might also
hold clues to the origin of FRBs as a population. We aim to detect the first
two repeating FRBs: FRB 121102 (R1) and FRB 180814.J0422+73 (R2), and
characterise their repeat statistics. We also want to significantly improve the
sky localisation of R2. We use the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to
conduct extensive follow-up of these two repeating FRBs. The new phased-array
feed system, Apertif, allows covering the entire sky position uncertainty of R2
with fine spatial resolution in one pointing. We characterise the energy
distribution and the clustering of detected R1 bursts. We detected 30 bursts
from R1. Our measurements indicate a dispersion measure of 563.5(2) pc
cm$^{-3}$, suggesting a significant increase in DM over the past few years. We
place an upper limit of 8% on the linear polarisation fraction of the brightest
burst. We did not detect any bursts from R2. A single power-law might not fit
the R1 burst energy distribution across the full energy range or widely
separated detections. Our observations provide improved constraints on the
clustering of R1 bursts. Our stringent upper limits on the linear polarisation
fraction imply a significant depolarisation, either intrinsic to the emission
mechanism or caused by the intervening medium, at 1400 MHz that is not observed
at higher frequencies. The non-detection of any bursts from R2 implies either a
highly clustered nature of the bursts, a steep spectral index, or a combination
of both. Alternatively, R2 has turned off completely, either permanently or for
an extended period of time.

Intense radiation field can modify plasma properties, the corresponding
refractive index, and lead to such nonlinear propagation effects as
self-focusing. We estimate the corresponding effects in pair plasma, both in
unmagnetized and strongly magnetically dominated case. First, in the
unmagnetized pair plasma the ponderomotive force does not lead to charge
separation, but to density depletion. Second, for astrophysically relevant
plasmas of pulsar magnetospheres, (and possible loci of Fast Radio Bursts),
where cyclotron frequency $\omega_B$ dominates over plasma frequency $\omega_p$
and the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, $\omega_B \gg \omega_p,\,
\omega$, we show that (i) there is virtually no nonlinearity due to changing
effective mass in the field of the wave; (ii) ponderomotive force is $F_p^{(B)}
=- {m_e c^2}/({4 B_0^2}) \nabla E^2$; it is reduced by a factor
$(\omega/\omega_B)^2$ if compared to the unmagnetized case ($B_0$ is the
external magnetic field and $E$ is the electric field of the wave); (iii) for
radiation beam propagating along constant magnetic field in pair plasma with
density $n_\pm$, the ponderomotive force leads to appearance of circular
currents that lead to the decrease of the field within the beam by a factor
$\Delta B/B_0 = 2\pi n_\pm m_e c^2 {E^2}/{B_0^4}$. Applications to the physics
of FRBs are discussed; we conclude that for parameters of FRB's the dominant
magnetic field completely suppresses nonlinear radiation effects.

Rotation measure synthesis allows the estimation of Faraday dispersion via a
Fourier transform and is the primary tool to probe cosmic magnetic fields. We
show this can be considered mathematically equivalent to the one dimensional
interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit in a different Fourier
space. As a result, familiar concepts in two dimensional intensity
interferometry designed to correctly account for a range of instrumental
conditions can be translated to the analysis of Faraday dispersion. In
particular, we show how to model the effect of channel averaging during Faraday
reconstruction, which has to date limited the progress of polarimetic science
using wide-band measurements. Further, we simulate 1d sparse reconstruction
with channel averaging for realistic frequency coverages, and show that it is
possible to recover signals with large rotation measure values that were
previously excluded from possible detection. This is especially important for
low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. We extended these ideas to introduce
mosaicking in Faraday depth into the channel averaging process. This work, thus
provides the first framework for correctly undertaking wide-band rotation
measure synthesis, including the provision to add data from multiple
telescopes, a prospect that should vastly improve the quality and quantity of
polarimetric science. This is of particular importance for extreme environments
which generate high magnetic fields such as those associated with pulsars and
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will allow such sources to be accurately used as
probes of cosmological fields.

We present projected Fast Radio Burst detection rates from surveys carried
out using a set of hypothetical close-packed array telescopes. The cost
efficiency of such a survey falls at least as fast as the inverse square of the
survey frequency. There is an optimum array element effective area in the range
0 to 25 $\rm{m^2}$. If the power law index of the FRB integrated source count
versus fluence $\alpha = d ~ln R/d ~ln F > -1$ the most cost effective
telescope layout uses individual dipole elements, which provides an all-sky
field of view. If $\alpha <-1$ dish arrays are more cost effective.

We explore the burst energy distribution of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the
low-twist magnetar model of Wadiasingh and Timokhin (2019). Motivated by the
power-law fluence distributions of FRB 121102, we propose an elementary model
for the FRB luminosity function of individual repeaters with an inversion
protocol which directly relates the power-law distribution index of magnetar
short burst fluences to that for FRBs. The protocol indicates the FRB energy
scales virtually linearly with crust/field dislocation amplitude, if magnetar
short bursts prevail in the magnetoelastic regime. Charge starvation in the
magnetosphere during bursts (required in WT19) for individual repeaters implies
the predicted burst fluence distribution is narrow, $\lesssim 3$ decades for
yielding strains and oscillation frequencies feasible in magnetar crusts.
Requiring magnetic confinement and charge starvation, we obtain a death line
for FRBs which segregates magnetars from the normal pulsar population,
suggesting only the former will host recurrent FRBs. We convolve the burst
energy distribution for individual magnetars to define the distribution of
luminosities in evolved magnetar populations. The broken power-law luminosity
function's low energy character depends on the population model, while the high
energy index traces that of individual repeaters. Independent of the evolved
population, the broken power-law isotropic-equivalent energy/luminosity
function peaks at $\sim10^{37}-10^{40}$ erg with a low-energy cutoff at $\sim
10^{37}$ erg. Lastly, we consider the local fluence distribution of FRBs, and
find that it can constrain the subset of FRB-producing magnetar progenitors.
Our model suggests that improvements in sensitivity may reveal flattening of
the global FRB fluence distribution and saturation in FRB rates.

Young pulsars and the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) or supernova remnants (SNRs)
that surround them are some of the most dynamic and high-powered environments
in our Universe. With the rise of more sensitive observations, the number of
pulsar-SNR and PWN associations (hereafter, SNR/PWN) has increased, yet we do
not understand to which extent this environment influences the pulsars'
impulsive radio signals. We studied the dispersive contribution of SNRs and
PWNe on Galactic pulsars, and considered their relevance to fast radio bursts
(FRBs) such as FRB 121102. We investigated the dispersion measure (DM)
contribution of SNRs and PWNe by comparing the measured DMs of Galactic pulsars
in a SNR/PWN to the DM expected only from the intervening interstellar
electrons, using the NE2001 model. We find that a two-$\sigma$ DM contribution
of SNRs and PWNe to the pulsar signal exists, amounting to $21.1 \pm 10.6$ pc
cm$^{-3}$. The control sample of pulsars unassociated with a SNR/PWN shows no
excess. We model the SNR and PWN electron densities for each young pulsar in
our sample and show that these indeed predict an excess of this magnitude. By
extrapolating to the kind of fast-spinning, high magnetic field, young pulsars
that may power FRBs, we show their SNR and PWN are capable of significantly
contributing to the observed DM.

There are several unexplored regions of the short-duration radio transient
phase space. One such unexplored region is the luminosity gap between giant
pulses (from pulsars) and cosmologically located fast radio bursts (FRBs). The
Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) is a search for
such transients out to 7 Mpc. STARE2 has a field of view of 3.6 steradians and
is sensitive to one-millisecond transients above $\sim300$ kJy. With a
two-station system we have detected and localized a solar burst, demonstrating
that the pilot system is capable of detecting short duration radio transients.
We found no convincing transients with duration between 65 $\mu$s and 34 ms in
200 days of observing, limiting with 95% confidence the all-sky rate of
transients above $\sim300$ kJy to $< 40$ ${\rm sky^{-1} year^{-1}}$. If the
luminosity function of FRBs could be extrapolated down to 300 kJy for a
distance of 10 kpc, then one would expect the rate to be $\sim2$ ${\rm sky^{-1}
year^{-1}}$.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, bright, extragalactic radio flashes.
Their physical origin remains unknown, but dozens of possible models have been
postulated. Some FRB sources exhibit repeat bursts. Though over a hundred FRB
sources have been discovered to date, only four have been localised and
associated with a host galaxy, with just one of the four known to repeat. The
properties of the host galaxies, and the local environments of FRBs, provide
important clues about their physical origins. However, the first known
repeating FRB has been localised to a low-metallicity, irregular dwarf galaxy,
and the apparently non-repeating sources to higher-metallicity, massive
elliptical or star-forming galaxies, suggesting that perhaps the repeating and
apparently non-repeating sources could have distinct physical origins. Here we
report the precise localisation of a second repeating FRB source, FRB
180916.J0158+65, to a star-forming region in a nearby (redshift $z = 0.0337 \pm
0.0002$) massive spiral galaxy, whose properties and proximity distinguish it
from all known hosts. The lack of both a comparably luminous persistent radio
counterpart and a high Faraday rotation measure further distinguish the local
environment of FRB 180916.J0158+65 from that of the one previously localised
repeating FRB source, FRB 121102. This demonstrates that repeating FRBs have a
wide range of luminosities, and originate from diverse host galaxies and local
environments.

We present program objectives and specifications for the first generation
Ultra-Fast Astronomy (UFA) observatory which will explore a new astrophysical
phase space by characterizing the variability of the optical (320 nm - 650 nm)
sky in the millisecond to nanosecond timescales. One of the first objectives of
the UFA observatory will be to search for optical counterparts to fast radio
bursts (FRB) that can be used to identify the origins of FRB and probe the
epoch of reionization and baryonic matter in the interstellar and intergalactic
mediums. The UFA camera will consist of two single-photon resolution
fast-response detector 16x16 arrays operated in coincidence mounted on the 0.7
meter Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at the Assy-Turgen
Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO) located near Almaty, Kazakhstan. We are
currently developing two readout systems that can measure down to the
microsecond and nanosecond timescales and characterizing two silicon
photomultipliers (SiPM) and one photomultiplier tube (PMT) to compare the
detectors for the UFA observatory and astrophysical observations in general.

Understanding the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB's) is a central unsolved
problem in astrophysics that is severely hampered by their poorly determined
distance scale. Determining the redshift distribution of FRB's appears to
require arcsecond angular resolution, in order to associate FRB's with host
galaxies. In this paper, we forecast prospects for determining the redshift
distribution without host galaxy associations, by cross-correlating FRB's with
a galaxy catalog such as the SDSS photometric sample. The forecasts are
extremely promising: a survey such as CHIME/FRB that measures catalogs of $\sim
10^3$ FRB's with few-arcminute angular resolution can place strong constraints
on the FRB redshift distribution, by measuring the cross-correlation as a
function of galaxy redshift $z$ and FRB dispersion measure $D$. In addition,
propagation effects from free electron inhomogeneities modulate the observed
FRB number density, either by shifting FRB's between dispersion measure (DM)
bins or through DM-dependent selection effects. We show that these propagation
effects, coupled with the spatial clustering between galaxies and free
electrons, can produce FRB-galaxy correlations which are comparable to the
intrinsic clustering signal. Such effects can be disentangled based on their
angular and $(z, D)$ dependence, providing an opportunity to study not only
FRB's but the clustering of free electrons.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient intense radio pulses with duration of
milliseconds. Although the first FRB was detected more than a decade ago, the
progenitors of these energetic events are not yet known. The currently
preferred formation channel involves the formation of a neutron star
(NS)/magnetar. While these objects are often the end product of the
core-collapse (CC) explosion of massive stars, they could also be the outcome
of the merging of two massive white dwarfs. In the merger scenario the ejected
material interacts with a constant-density circumbinary medium and creates
supersonic shocks. We found that when a radio pulse passes through these shocks
the dispersion measure (DM) increases with time during the free expansion
phase. The rotation measure (RM) displays a similar trend if the power-law
index, $n$, of the outer part of the ejecta is $>6$. For $n = 6$ the RM remains
constant during this phase. Later, when the ejecta move into the Sedov-Taylor
phase while the DM still increases, however, with a different rate, the RM
reduces. This behaviour is somewhat similar to that of FRB 121102 for which a
marginal increase of DM and a 10% decrease of RM have been observed over time.
These features are in contrast to the CC scenario, where the DM and RM
contributions to the radio signal always diminish with time.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07620v1
We explore a novel search strategy for dark matter in the form of massive
compact halo objects (MACHOs) such as primordial black holes or dense
mini-halos in the mass range from $10^{-4}$ to 0.1 solar masses. These objects
can gravitationally lens the signal of fast radio bursts (FRBs), producing a
characteristic interference pattern in the frequency spectrum, similar to the
previously studied femtolensing signal in gamma ray burst spectra. Unlike
traditional searches using microlensing, FRB lensing will probe the abundance
of MACHOs at cosmological distance scales (~Gpc) rather than just their
distribution in the neighborhood of the Milky Way. The method is thus
particularly relevant for dark mini-halos, which may be inaccessible to
microlensing due to their finite spatial extent or tidal disruption in
galaxies. We find that the main complication in FRB lensing will be
interstellar scintillation in the FRB's host galaxy and in the Milky Way.
Scintillation is difficult to quantify because it heavily depends on turbulence
in the interstellar medium, which is poorly understood. We show that,
nevertheless, for realistic scintillation parameters, FRB lensing can set
competitive limits on compact dark matter object, and we back our findings with
explicit simulations.

The fast radio burst, FRB 171019, was relatively bright when discovered first
by ASKAP, but was identified as a repeater with three faint bursts detected
later by GBT and CHIME. These observations lead to the discussion of whether
the first bright burst shares the same mechanism with the following repeating
bursts. A model of binary neutron star merger is proposed for FRB 171019, in
which the first bright burst occurred during the merger event, while the
subsequent repeating bursts are starquake-induced, and generally fainter, as
the energy release rate for the starquakes can hardly exceed that of the
catastrophic merger event. This scenario is consistent with the observation
that no burst detected is as bright as the first one.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10026v2
We report the detection of repeat bursts from the source of FRB 171019, one
of the brightest fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected in the Australian Square
Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) fly's eye survey. Two bursts from the source
were detected with the Green Bank Telescope in observations centered at 820
MHz. The repetitions are a factor of $\sim 590$ fainter than the
ASKAP-discovered burst. All three bursts from this source show no evidence of
scattering and have consistent pulse widths. The pulse spectra show modulation
that could be evidence for either steep spectra or patchy emission. The two
repetitions were the only ones found in an observing campaign for this FRB
totaling 1000 hr, which also included ASKAP and the 64-m Parkes radio
telescope, over a range of frequencies (720$-$2000 MHz) at epochs spanning two
years. The inferred scaling of repetition rate with fluence of this source
agrees with the other repeating source, FRB 121102. The detection of faint
pulses from FRB 171019 shows that at least some FRBs selected from bright
samples will repeat if follow-up observations are conducted with more sensitive
telescopes.

The statistical properties of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 are
investigated. We find that the cumulative distributions of fluence, flux
density, total energy and waiting time can be well fitted by the bent power
law. In addition, the probability density functions of fluctuations of fluence,
flux density and total energy well follow the Tsallis $q$-Gaussian
distribution. The $q$ values keep steady around $q\sim 2$ for different scale
intervals, indicating a scale-invariant structure of the bursts. The
statistical properties of FRB 121102 are very similar to that of the soft gamma
repeater SGR J1550-5418. The underlying physical implications need to be
further investigated.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12833v1
The properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate that the physical origin
of this type of astrophysical phenomenon is related to neutron stars. The first
detected repeating source, FRB 121102, is associated with a persistent radio
counterpart. In this paper, we propose that this radio counterpart could arise
from a pulsar wind nebula powered by a magnetar without surrounding supernova
ejecta. Its medium is a stratified structure produced by a progenitor wind. The
model parameters are constrained by the spectrum of the counterpart emission,
the size of the nebula, and the large but decreasing rotation measure (RM) of
the repeating bursts. In addition, the observed dispersion measure is
consistent with the assumption that all of the RM comes from the shocked
medium.

Bright, short radio bursts are emitted by sources at a large range of
distances: from the nearby Crab pulsar to remote Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs
are likely to originate from distant neutron stars, but our knowledge of the
radio pulsar population has been limited to the Galaxy and the Magellanic
Clouds. In an attempt to increase our understanding of extragalactic pulsar
populations, and its giant-pulse emission, we employed the low-frequency radio
telescope LOFAR to search the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) for radio bursts emitted
by young, Crab-like pulsars. For direct comparison we also present a LOFAR
study on the low-frequency giant pulses from the Crab pulsar; their fluence
distribution follows a power law with slope 3.04(3). A number of candidate
signals were detected from M31 but none proved persistent. FRBs are sometimes
thought of as Crab-like pulsars with exceedingly bright giant pulses -- given
our sensitivity, we can rule out that M31 hosts pulsars more than an order of
magnitude brighter than the Crab pulsar, assuming their pulse scattering
follows that of the known FRBs.

[Abridged] By appealing to a Quark-Nova (QN; the explosive transition of a
neutron star to a quark star) in the wake of a core-collapse Supernova
explosion of a massive star, we develop a unified model for long duration
Gamma-ray Bursts (LGRBs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The time delay (years to
decades) between the SN and the QN and, the fragmented nature (i.e. millions of
chunks) of the relativistic QN ejecta are key to yielding a robust LGRB engine.
In our model, a LGRB light-curve exhibits the interaction of the fragmented QN
ejecta with a turbulent (i.e. filamentary and magnetically saturated) SN ejecta
which is shaped by its interaction with an underlying pulsar wind nebula (PWN).
The afterglow is due to the interaction of the QN chunks, exiting the SN
ejecta, with the surrounding medium. Our model can fit BAT/XRT prompt and
afterglow light-curves, simultaneously with their spectra, thus yielding the
observed properties of LGRBs (e.g. the Band function and the X-ray flares). We
find that the Yonetoku law and the Amati law are not fundamental but
phenomenological. FRBs result from coherent synchrotron emission when the QN
chunks interact with non-turbulent weakly magnetized PWN-SN ejecta, where
conditions are prone to the Weibel instability. Magnetic field amplification
induced by the Weibel instability sets the bunching length for electrons and
pairs to radiate coherently. The resulting emission frequency, luminosity,
duration and dispersion measure in our model are consistent with FRB data. We
find a natural unification of high-energy burst phenomena from FRBs to LGRBs
including X-ray Flashes and X-ray rich GRBs as well as Super-Luminous SNe. We
find a possible connection between Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and FRBs and
propose that a QN following a binary neutron star merger can yield a short GRB
(SGRB) with fits to BAT/XRT light-curves.

A new model of the Milky Way (MW) halo component of the dispersion measure
(DM) for extragalactic sources, such as fast radio bursts (FRBs), is presented
in light of recent diffuse X-ray observations. In addition to the spherical
component of isothermal gas ($kT\sim0.3$ keV) in hydrostatic equilibrium with
the Galactic gravitational potential, our model includes a disk-like
non-spherical hot gas component to reproduce the directional dependence of the
observed X-ray emission measure (EM). The total gas mass
($1.2\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) is dominated by the spherical component, and is
consistent with the total baryon mass of the MW expected from the dark matter
mass and the cosmic baryon-to-dark-matter ratio. Our model predicts a mean halo
DM of $43\:\,{\rm pc\:cm^{-3}}$, with a full range of $30$-$245\:\,{\rm
pc\:cm^{-3}}$ over the whole sky. The large scatter seen in the X-ray EM data
implies a $\sim0.2$ dex (rms) fluctuation of the MW halo DM. We provide an
analytic formula to estimate the MW halo DM of our model along any line of
sight, which can be easily used to compute the total MW component of DM toward
extragalactic sources, in combination with existing DM models of the warm
ionized medium associated with the Galactic disk.

The small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) is dominated by
anisotropies from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, and upcoming
experiments will measure it very precisely, but the optical depth degeneracy
limits the cosmological information that can be extracted. At the same time,
fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an exciting new frontier for astrophysics, but
their usefulness as cosmological probes is currently unclear. We show that FRBs
are uniquely suited for breaking the kSZ optical depth degeneracy. This opens
up new possibilities for constraining cosmology with the kSZ effect, and new
cosmological applications for FRBs.

The Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) is a
next-generation radio telescope, proposed for construction to start
immediately. CHORD is a pan-Canadian project, designed to work with and build
on the success of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME).
It is an ultra-wideband, "large-N, small-D" telescope, consisting of a central
array of 512x6-m dishes, supported by a pair of distant outrigger stations,
each equipped with CHIME-like cylinders and a 64-dish array. CHORD will measure
the distribution of matter over a huge swath of the Universe, detect and
localize tens of thousands of Fast RadioBursts (FRBs), and undertake
cutting-edge measurements of fundamental physics.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short lived ($\sim$ msec), energetic transients
(having a peak flux density of $\sim$ Jy) with no known prompt emission in
other energy bands. We present results of a search for prompt X-ray emissions
from 41 FRBs using the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) on AstroSat which
continuously monitors $\sim70\%$ of the sky. Our searches on various timescales
in the 20-200 keV range, did not yield any counterparts in this hard X-ray
band. We calculate upper limits on hard X-ray flux, in the same energy range
and convert them to upper bounds for $\eta$: the ratio X-ray to radio fluence
of FRBs. We find $\eta \leq 10^{8-10}$ for hard X-ray emission. Our results
will help constrain the theoretical models of FRBs as the models become more
quantitative and nearer, brighter FRBs are discovered.

In this paper, we present statistics of soft gamma repeater (SGR) bursts from
SGR J1550-5418, SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14 by adding new bursts from
K{\i}rm{\i}z{\i}bayrak et al. (2017) detected with the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE). We find that the fluence distributions of magnetar bursts are
well described by power-law functions with indices 1.84, 1.68, and 1.65 for SGR
J1550-5418, SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14, respectively. The duration
distributions of magnetar bursts also show power-law forms. Meanwhile, the
waiting time distribution can be described by a non-stationary Poisson process
with an exponentially growing occurrence rate. These distributive features
indicate that magnetar bursts can be regarded as a self-organizing critical
process. We also compare these distributions with the repeating FRB 121102. The
statistical properties of repeating FRB 121102 are similar with magentar
bursts, combing with the large required magnetic filed ($B\geq 10^{14}$G) of
neutron star for FRB 121102, which indicates that the central engine of FRB
121102 may be a magnetar.

We report on the discovery of eight repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources
found using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
telescope. These sources span a dispersion measure (DM) range of 103.5 to 1281
pc cm$^{-3}$. They display varying degrees of activity: six sources were
detected twice, another three times, and one ten times. These eight repeating
FRBs likely represent the bright and/or high-rate end of a distribution of
infrequently repeating sources. For all sources, we determine sky coordinates
with uncertainties of $\sim$10$^\prime$. FRB 180916.J0158+65 has a
burst-averaged DM = $349.2 \pm 0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and a low DM excess over the
modelled Galactic maximum (as low as $\sim$20 pc cm$^{-3}$); this source also
has a Faraday rotation measure (RM) of $-114.6 \pm 0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$, much
lower than the RM measured for FRB 121102. FRB 181030.J1054+73 has the lowest
DM for a repeater, $103.5 \pm 0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$, with a DM excess of $\sim$ 70
pc cm$^{-3}$. Both sources are interesting targets for multi-wavelength
follow-up due to their apparent proximity. The DM distribution of our repeater
sample is statistically indistinguishable from that of the first 12 CHIME/FRB
sources that have not repeated. We find, with 4$\sigma$ significance, that
repeater bursts are generally wider than those of CHIME/FRB bursts that have
not repeated, suggesting different emission mechanisms. Our repeater events
show complex morphologies that are reminiscent of the first two discovered
repeating FRBs. The repetitive behavior of these sources will enable
interferometric localizations and subsequent host galaxy identifications.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of an unknown origin.
Naturally, we are curious as to their nature. Enough FRBs have been detected
for a statistical approach to parts of this challenge to be feasible. To
understand the crucial link between detected FRBs and the underlying FRB source
classes we perform FRB population synthesis, to determine how the underlying
population behaves. The Python package we developed for this synthesis,
frbpoppy, is open source and freely available. Our goal is to determine the
current best fit FRB population model. Our secondary aim is to provide an
easy-to-use tool for simulating and understanding FRB detections. It can
compare surveys, or inform us of the intrinsic FRB population. frbpoppy
simulates intrinsic FRB populations and the surveys that find them, to produce
virtual observed populations. These resulting populations can then be compared
with real data, allowing constrains to be placed on underlying physics and
selection effects. We are able to replicate real Parkes and ASKAP FRB surveys,
in terms of both detection rates and distributions observed. We also show the
effect of beam patterns on the observed dispersion measure (DM) distributions.
We compare four types of source models. The "Complex" model, featuring a range
of luminosities, pulse widths and spectral indices, reproduces current
detections best. Using frbpoppy, an open-source FRB population synthesis
package, we explain current FRB detections and offer a first glimpse of what
the true population must be.

The nature of the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the
composition of their relativistic jets are still under debate. If the jets are
Poynting flux dominated rather than baryon dominated, a coherent radio flare
from magnetic re-connection events might be expected with the prompt gamma-ray
emission. There are two competing models for the central engines of GRBs; a
black hole or a newly formed milli-second magnetar. If the central engine is a
magnetar it is predicted to produce coherent radio emission as persistent or
flaring activity. In this paper, we present the deepest limits to date for this
emission following LOFAR rapid response observations of GRB 180706A. No
emission is detected to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 1.7 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 144 MHz in
a two-hour LOFAR observation starting 4.5 minutes after the gamma-ray trigger.
A forced source extraction at the position of GRB 180706A provides a marginally
positive (1 sigma) peak flux density of $1.1 \pm 0.9$ mJy. The data were
time-sliced into different sets of snapshot durations to search for FRB like
emission. No short duration emission was detected at the location of the GRB.
We compare these results to theoretical models and discuss the implications of
a non-detection.

We present results of a search for late-time radio emission and Fast Radio
Bursts (FRBs) from a sample of type-I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). We
used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe ten SLSN-I more than 5
years old at a frequency of 3 GHz. We searched fast-sampled visibilities for
FRBs and used the same data to perform a deep imaging search for late-time
radio emission expected in models of magnetar-powered supernovae. No FRBs were
found. One SLSN-I, PTF10hgi, is detected in deep imaging, corresponding to a
luminosity of $1.2\times10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This luminosity, considered with
the recent 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi in Eftekhari et al (2019), supports the
interpretation that it is powered by a young, fast-spinning ($\sim$ ms spin
period) magnetar with $\sim$ 15 Msun of partially ionized ejecta. Broadly, our
observations are most consistent with SLSNe-I being powered by neutron stars
with fast spin periods, although most require more free-free absorption than is
inferred for PTF10hgi. We predict that radio observations at higher frequencies
or in the near future will detect these systems and begin constraining
properties of the young pulsars and their birth environments.

Boson stars may consist of a new type of light singlet scalar particles with
nontrivial self-interactions, and may compose a fraction of the dark matter in
the Universe. In this work, we study the dynamics of boson stars with Liouville
and logarithmic scalar self-interaction potentials as benchmarks. We perform a
numerical analysis as well as a semi-analytic study on how the compactness and
the total mass will deviate from that of the usual boson stars formed with a
quartic repulsive self-interaction. We apply the recently suggested Swampland
conjecture to examine whether boson stars with such benchmark potentials belong
to the Landscape of a quantum gravity. Using the mass constraint on the
macroscopic compact halo object (MACHO) and the cold dark matter (CDM)
isocurvature mode constraint from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we
derive the allowed mass range of scalar particles which compose the boson star.
We further analyze applications of the lensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and
the gravitational wave (GW) detection to probe the presence of such boson stars
and constrain the parameter space of their corresponding models. We discuss how
the two types of boson star potentials can be discriminated by the FRB and GW
measurements.

Some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be caused by the mergers
of binary neutron stars which may sometimes produce massive neutron star
remnants capable of producing extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs). We
conducted a deep search for FRBs from the sites of six low-redshift SGRBs. We
collected high time- and frequency-resolution data from each of the sites for
10 hours using the 2 GHz receiver of the Green Bank Telescope. Two of the SGRB
sites we targeted were visible with the Arecibo Radio Telescope with which we
conducted an additional 10 hours of 1.4 GHz observations for each. We searched
our data for FRBs using the GPU-optimized dedispersion algorithm
$\texttt{heimdall}$ and the machine-learning-based package $\texttt{FETCH}$
(Fast Extragalactic Transient Candidate Hunter). We did not discover any FRBs,
but would have detected any with peak flux densities in excess of 87 mJy at the
Green Bank Telescope or 21 mJy at Arecibo with a signal-to-noise ratio of at
least 10. The isotropic-equivalent energy of any FRBs emitted from these sites
in our bands during our observations must not have exceeded a few times
$10^{38}$ erg, comparable to some of the lowest energy bursts yet seen from the
first known repeating FRB 121102.

Present-day galaxies are surrounded by cool and enriched halo gas extending
to hundreds of kiloparsecs. This halo gas is thought to be the dominant
reservoir of material available to fuel future star formation, but direct
constraints on its mass and physical properties have been difficult to obtain.
We report the detection of a fast radio burst (FRB 181112) with arcsecond
precision, which passes through the halo of a foreground galaxy. Analysis of
the burst shows the halo gas has low net magnetization and turbulence. Our
results imply predominantly diffuse gas in massive galactic halos, even those
hosting active supermassive black holes, contrary to some previous results.

We present statistical analysis of a fluence limited sample of over 1100
giant pulses from the Crab pulsar, with fluence > 130 Jy ms at ~1330 MHz. These
were detected in ~260 hours of observation with the National Centre for Radio
Astrophysics (NCRA)-15m radio telescope. We find that the pulse energy
distribution follows a power law with index $\alpha\approx$-3 at least up to a
fluence of ~5 Jy s. The power law index agrees well with that found for lower
energy pulses in the range 3-30 Jy ms. The fluence distribution of the Crab
pulsar hence appears to follow a single power law over ~3 orders of magnitude
in fluence. We do not see any evidence for the flattening at high fluences
reported by earlier studies. We also find that at these fluence levels, the
rate of giant-pulse emission varies by as much as a factor of ~5 on time-scales
of a few days, although the power law index of the pulse-energy distribution
remains unchanged. The slope of the fluence distribution for Crab giant pulses
is similar to that recently determined for the repeating FRB 121102. We also
find an anti-correlation between the pulse fluence and the pulse width, so that
more energetic pulses are preferentially shorter.

The nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), which occurs on millisecond time
scales in the radio band, has not been well-understood. Among their unknown
observational properties are their broadband spectra and persistent and
transient multi-wavelength counterparts. Well-localized FRBs provide us the
opportunity to address these issues in archival observations. We have performed
searches for 15-150 keV hard X-ray bursts on time scales as short as
millisecond in the direction of the repeating FRB 121102 (with a spacial
resolution of a few arcminutes) in the archival Swift/BAT data during the
period between October 2016 and September 2017. We have found no significant (5
$\sigma$) hard X-ray bursts in the direction of the repeating FRB. We have
derived an upper limit of the hard X-ray (15--150 keV) flux of any X-ray bursts
on 1 ms time scale of around $1.01 \times 10^{-7}$erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, if
assuming a photo-index of 2 for potential X-ray flares in X-ray band. A
plausible scenario for the repeating FRB as being associated with
\emph{magnetar giant flare} is still far below the upper limit.

Multi-messenger astronomy combining Gravitational Wave (GW) and
Electromagnetic Wave (EM) observation brings huge impact on physics,
astrophysics and cosmology. However, the majority of sources to be detected
with currently running ground-based GW observatories are binary black hole
(BBH) mergers, which are expected disappointedly to have no EM counterparts. In
this letter, we propose that if the BBH merger happens in a gaseous disk around
a supermassive black hole, the merger can be accompanied by a transient radio
flare alike a fast radio burst (FRB). We argue that the total mass and the
effective spin derived from GW detection can be used to distinguish such a
source from other channels of BBH mergers. If the prediction is confirmed with
future observation, multi-messenger astronomy can be brought to a distance
which is one order of magnitude farther than present. The mystery of the origin
of FRBs can also be revealed partially.

In this paper we study two newly discovered classes of radio sources: the
highly energetic, short-lived events, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and a
new category of compact sources known as Fanaroff-Riley type 0 radio galaxies
(FR0s). Due to a possible catastrophic event origin for the FRBs and a previous
correlation found with an FR0 in the gamma ray spectrum, it is possible that
these radio sources could also emit high energy photons in the Fermi-LAT
satellite energy range (20 MeV - 300GeV). Here we present an exhaustive
time-dependent and spatial search of all up-to-date observed FRBs and FR0s,
respectively. We perform a likelihood analysis of the radio sources by modeling
the excess flux of gamma rays with a varying index power law function using
data from Fermi-LAT and the 4FGL catalog. Sources with test statistic greater
than 16 (corresponding to about 4{\sigma}) were further analyzed including 2
FRBs and 7 FR0s. No correlations with more than 5{\sigma} were found after
taking into account nearby sources. Therefore, upper limits for all sources
were calculated

The rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the direction of nearby galaxy
clusters is expected to be higher than the mean cosmological rate if
intrinsically faint FRBs are numerous. In this paper, we describe a targeted
search for faint FRBs near the core of the Virgo cluster using the Australian
Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder telescope. During 300 hr of observations, we
discovered one burst, FRB 180417, with dispersion measure DM $=474.8$
cm$^{-3}$pc. The FRB was promptly followed up by several radio telescopes for
27 h, but no repeat bursts were detected. An optical follow-up of FRB 180417
using the PROMPT5 telescope revealed no new sources down to an $R$-band
magnitude of 20.1. We argue that FRB 180417 is likely behind the Virgo cluster
as the Galactic and intracluster DM contribution are small compared to the DM
of the FRB, and there are no galaxies in the line of sight. The non-detection
of FRBs from Virgo constrains the faint-end slope, $\alpha<1.52$ (at 68\%
confidence limit), and the minimum luminosity, $L_{\rm min}\gtrsim 2\times
10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 68\% confidence limit), of the FRB luminosity
function assuming cosmic FRB rate of $10^4$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ with
flux above 1 Jy located out to redshift of 1. Further FRB surveys of galaxy
clusters with high-sensitivity instruments will tighten the constraints on the
faint end of the luminosity function and, thus, are strongly encouraged.

Context. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-long bursts uniquely
detected at radio frequencies. FRB 131104 is the only case for which a
$\gamma$-ray transient positionally and temporally consistent was claimed. This
high-energy transient had a duration of $\sim400$~s and a 15-150~keV fluence
$S_{\gamma}\sim4\times10^{-6}$ erg $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. However, the association
with the FRB is still debated. Aims. We aim at testing the systematic presence
of an associated transient high-energy counterpart throughout a sample of the
FRB population. Methods. We used an approach like that used in machine learning
methodologies to accurately model the highly-variable Fermi/GBM instrumental
background on a time interval comparable to the duration of the proposed
$\gamma$-ray counterpart of FRB 131104. A possible $\gamma$-ray signal is then
constrained considering sample average lightcurves. Results. We constrain the
fluence of the possible $\gamma$-ray signal in the 8-1000 keV band down to $6.4
\times 10^{-7}$ ($7.1 \times 10^{-8}$) erg cm$^{-2}$ for a 200-s (1-s)
integration time. Furthermore, we found the radio-to-gamma fluence ratio to be
$\eta>10^{8}$ Jy ms erg$^{-1}$ cm$^2$. Conclusions. Our fluence limits exclude
$\sim 94\%$ of Fermi/GBM detected long gamma-ray bursts and $\sim 96\%$ of
Fermi/GBM detected short gamma-ray bursts. In addition, our limits on the
radio-to-gamma fluence ratio point to a different emission mechanism from that
of magnetar giant flares. Finally, we exclude a $\gamma$-ray counterpart as
fluent as the one possibly associated with FRB 131104 to be a common feature of
FRBs.

We demonstrate how the FRB redshift and fluence distributions from the
Parkes, ASKAP and CHIME telescopes can be used together to constrain the
properties of the FRB population. Here we consider a simple model where all the
FRBs have the same spectral index $\alpha$ and rest frame energy $E$ (specified
in a fixed band $2128\;{\rm MHz}$ to $2848\;{\rm MHz}$). We find that the
constraints on $(\alpha,E)$ depend on the scattering model for pulse broadening
in the inter-galactic medium. For no scattering we find that there is a region
of parameter space where the predictions are simultaneously consistent with the
FRB redshift and fluence distributions at all three telescopes. The allowed
$\alpha$ range is bounded by $-6.0\leq \alpha \leq-3.6$ and the allowed $E$
range is bounded by $1.79\times 10^{33}{\rm J} \leq E \leq 5.41\times
10^{33}{\rm J}$. Our analysis also rules out an empirical scattering model
where the FRB pulse broadening in the IGM is predicted by extrapolating pulse
broadening observed for pulsars in the ISM.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an enigmatic class of extragalactic transients
emitting Jy-level radio bursts in the GHz band, lasting for only a few ms. So
far, some objects are known to repeat while several others are not, likely
indicating multiple origins. There are many theoretical models, some predict
prompt VHE or optical emission correlated with FRBs while others imply VHE
afterglows hours after the FRB. To test these predictions and unravel the
nature of FRB progenitors, the stereoscopic Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes (IACTs) system MAGIC has been participating in FRB observation
campaigns since 2016. As IACTs are sensitive to Cherenkov photons in the
UV/blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum and use photo-detectors with
time response faster than a ms, MAGIC is also able to perform simultaneous
optical observations through a dedicated system installed in the central PMT of
its camera. The main challenge faced by MAGIC in searching for optical
counterpart of FRBs is the presence of irreducible background optical events
due to terrestrial sources. We present new results from MAGIC observations of
the first repeating FRB 121102 during several MWL observation campaigns. The
recently improved instrument and refined strategy to search for counterparts of
FRBs in the VHE and optical bands will also be presented.

The dispersion measure -- redshift relation of Fast Radio Bursts,
$\mathrm{DM}(z)$, has been proposed as a potential new probe of the cosmos,
complementary to existing techniques. In practice, however, the effectiveness
of this approach depends on a number of factors, including (but not limited to)
the intrinsic scatter in the data caused by intervening matter inhomogeneities.
Here, we simulate a number of catalogues of mock FRB observations, and use MCMC
techniques to forecast constraints, and assess which parameters will likely be
best constrained. In all cases we find that any potential improvement in
cosmological constraints are limited by the current uncertainty on the the
diffuse gas fraction, $f_{\rm d}(z)$. Instead, we find that the precision of
current cosmological constraints allows one to constrain $f_{\rm d}(z)$, and
possibly its redshift evolution. Combining CMB + BAO + SNe + $H_0$ constraints
with just 100 FRBs (with redshifts), we find a typical constraint on the mean
diffuse gas fraction of a few percent. A detection of this nature would
alleviate the "missing baryon problem", and therefore highlights the value of
localisation and spectroscopic followup of future FRB detections.

We calculate the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic
medium (IGM) to the total measured DM for fast radio bursts (FRBs). We use the
MareNostrum Instituto de Ciencias del Espacio (MICE) Onion Universe simulation
(Fosalba et al. 2008) to track the evolution of the dark matter particle
density over a large range of redshifts. We convert this dark matter particle
number density to the corresponding free electron density and then integrate it
to find the DM as a function of redshift. This approach yields an intergalactic
DM of $\rm DM_{\rm IGM}(z = 1) = 800^{+7000}_{-170}$ pc cm$^{-3}$, with the
large errors representative of the structure in the IGM. We place limits on the
redshifts of the current population of observed FRBs. We also use our results
to estimate the host galaxy contribution to the DM for the first repeater, FRB
121102, and show that the most probable host galaxy DM contribution, $\rm
DM_{\rm host} \approx 310$ pc cm$^{-3}$, is consistent with the estimate made
using the Balmer emission lines in the spectrum of the host galaxy, $\rm
DM_{\rm Balmer} = 324$ pc cm$^{-3}$ (Tendulkar et al. 2017). We also compare
our predictions for the host galaxy contribution to the DM for the observations
of FRB 180924 (Bannister et al. 2019) and FRB 190523 (Ravi et al. 2019), both
of which have been localized to a host galaxy.

To assess the potential of a small telescopes for a high temporal resolution
astrophysics, we observed the field of FRB~121102 repeating source of fast
radio bursts on a 50-cm D50 telescope of Ond\v{r}ejov observatory, equipped
with a fast frame rate EMCCD detector. In a three nights of observations we did
not detect any optical flares from the source, which allows us to place an
upper limit of 10 mJy for a brightness of possible fast optical events on a
time scale of 10 ms. We also characterize the apparent brightness stability of
a field stars on the same time scale in order to investigate the potential of
such telescopes for detecting faint optical variability on a sub-second time
scales.

Although IceCube has discovered a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux, the
underlying sources of these neutrinos remain unknown. Transient astrophysical
objects, such as fast radio bursts (FRBs), could explain a large percentage of
the measured flux. We present the analysis techniques of IceCube searches for
MeV to TeV neutrinos from FRBs. As no significant correlation between IceCube
neutrinos and FRBs has been found, we present the first limit on MeV neutrino
emission from FRBs and the most constraining limits for neutrinos with GeV to
TeV energies. We also describe the prospects for future IceCube neutrino
searches coinciding with FRB detections from next generation radio
interferometers.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic radio pulses from cosmological
origins. Despite an abundance of detections, their nature remains elusive. At
least a subset of FRBs is expected to repeat, as the daily FRB rate surpasses
that of any known cataclysmic event, which has been confirmed by observations.
One of the proposed mechanisms to generate repeating FRBs is supergiant pulses
from young and highly spinning NSs, in which case FRBs could inherit the
periodicity of their parent NS. Here we examine the consequences of such a
population of periodic fast radio bursts (PFRBs). We calculate the rate and
lifetime of PFRB progenitors, and find that each newly born highly spinning NS
has to emit a number $N_{\rm PFRB}\sim 10^2$ of bursts during its active
lifetime of $\tau\sim 100$ years, after which it becomes too dim and crosses a
PFRB "death line" analogous to the pulsar one. We propose several tests of this
hypothesis. First, the period of PFRBs would increase over time, and their
luminosity would decrease, due to the NS spin-down. Second, PFRBs may show
modest amounts of rotation measure, given the lack of expelled matter from the
pulsar, as opposed to the magnetar-sourced FRBs proposed to explain the first
repeater FRB 121102. As an example, we study whether the second confirmed
repeater (FRB 180814) is a PFRB, given the preference for an inter-pulse
separation of 13 ms within its sub-bursts. We show that, if confirmed, this
period would place FRB 180814 in a different category as FRB 121102. We develop
tests that would identify---and characterize---the prospective population of
PFRBs.

Extragalactic dispersion measures (DMs) obtained from observations of fast
radio bursts (FRBs) are an excellent tool for probing intergalactic medium
(IGM) and for conducting cosmography. However, the DM contribution from the IGM
(${\rm DM_{IGM}}$) depends on the fraction of baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm
IGM}$, which is not properly constrained. As $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ is geometrically
related to the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and ${\rm DM_{IGM}}(z)$, here we propose
that combining two independent measurements of FRBs and $H(z)$ in similar
redshift ranges provides a novel and cosmology-free method to constrain the
evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$. Under the assumption that $f_{\rm IGM}$ is
evolving with redshift in a functional form, we forecast that the evolution of
$f_{\rm IGM}(z)$ can be well inferred in a combined analysis of $\sim3000$
${\rm DM_{IGM}}(z)$ derived from FRBs and $\sim50$ $H(z)$ derived from the
Hubble parameter data. Though the efficiency of our method is not as good as
that of the other model-independent method involving the joint measurements of
DM and luminosity distance of FRBs, our method offers a new model-independent
way to constrain $f_{\rm IGM}(z)$.

We characterized the S13360-3050CS Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), a
silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K..
Measurements were obtained inside a light tight dark box using 365 nm, 400 nm,
525 nm, 660 nm, 720 nm, 810 nm, and 900 nm light-emitting diodes (LED) and the
Citiroc 1A front-end evaluation system manufactured by Weeroc. At a 2.95V over
voltage, we measured a dark count rate of 5.07x$10^{5}$ counts per second at
26$^{\circ}$C, crosstalk probability of 8.7$\%$, photon detection efficiency of
36$\%$ at 400 nm, linear range of 1.8x$10^{7}$ photons per second, and
saturation at 5x$10^8$ photons per second. The S13360-3050CS MPPC is a
candidate detector for the Ultra-Fast Astronomy (UFA) telescope which will
characterize the optical sky in the millisecond to nanosecond timescales using
two SiPM arrays operated in coincidence mounted on the 0.7 meter Nazarbayev
University Transient Telescope at the Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory
(NUTTelA-TAO) located near Almaty, Kazakhstan. One objective of the UFA
telescope will be to search for optical counterparts to fast radio bursts (FRB)
that can be used to identify the origins of FRB and probe the epoch of
reionization and baryonic matter in the interstellar and intergalactic mediums.

The analogy of the host galaxy of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source
FRB 121102 and those of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and super-luminous
supernovae (SLSNe) has led to the suggestion that young magnetars born in GRBs
and SLSNe could be the central engine of repeating FRBs. We test such a
hypothesis by performing dedicated observations of the remnants of six GRBs
with evidence of having a magnetar central engine using the Arecibo telescope
and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). A total of $\sim 20$ hrs of
observations of these sources did not detect any FRB from these remnants. Under
the assumptions that all these GRBs left behind a long-lived magnetar and that
the bursting rate of FRB 121102 is typical for a magnetar FRB engine, we
estimate a non-detection probability of $8.9\times10^{-6}$. Even though these
non-detections cannot exclude the young magnetar model of FRBs, we place
constraints on the burst rate and luminosity function of FRBs from these GRB
targets.

Recently it was shown that cosmic anisotropy can be well tested using either
standard siren measurement of luminosity distance $d_\mathrm{L}(z)$ from
gravitational-wave (GW) observation or dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}(z)$)
from fast radio burst (FRB). It was also observed that the combined measurement
of $d_\mathrm{L}(z)\cdot\mathrm{DM}(z)$ from the GW/FRB association system as
suggested in some of FRB models is more effective to constrain cosmological
parameters than $d_\mathrm{L}(z)$ or $\mathrm{DM}(z)$ separately due to its
independence from Hubble constant. In this paper, we will show both
theoretically and with simulation that, this upgraded sirens from combined
GW/FRB observations could test cosmic anisotropy with a double relative
sensitivity compared to the usual standard siren from GW observation alone.

We search for host galaxy candidates of nearby fast radio bursts (FRBs), FRB
180729.J1316+55, FRB 171020, FRB 171213, FRB 180810.J1159+83, and FRB
180814.J0422+73 (the second repeating FRB). We compare the absolute magnitudes
and the expected host dispersion measure $\rm DM_{host}$ of these candidates
with that of the first repeating FRB, FRB 121102, as well as those of long
gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), the proposed
progenitor systems of FRB 121102. We find that while the FRB 121102 host is
consistent with those of LGRBs and SLSNe, the nearby FRB host candidates, at
least for FRB 180729.J1316+55, FRB 171020, and FRB180814.J0422+73, either have
a smaller $\rm DM_{host}$ or are fainter than FRB121102 host, as well as the
hosts of LGRBs and SLSNe. In order to avoid the uncertainty in estimating $\rm
DM_{host}$ due to the line-of-sight effect, we propose a galaxy-group-based
method to estimate the electron density in the inter-galactic regions, and
hence, $\rm DM_{IGM}$. The result strengthens our conclusion. We conclude that
the host galaxy of FRB 121102 is atypical, and LGRBs and SLSNe are likely not
the progenitor systems of at least most nearby FRB sources. {The recently
reported two FRB hosts differ from the host of FRB 121102 and also the host
candidates suggested in this paper. This is consistent with the conclusion of
our paper and suggests that the FRB hosts are very diverse. }

We describe GBTrans, a real-time search system designed to find fast radio
bursts (FRBs) using the 20-m radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory. The
telescope has been part of the Skynet educational program since 2015. We give
details of the observing system and report on the non-detection of FRBs from a
total observing time of 503 days. Single pulses from four known pulsars were
detected as part of the commensal observing. The system is sensitive enough to
detect approximately half of all currently known FRBs and we estimate that our
survey probed redshifts out to about 0.3 corresponding to an effective survey
volume of around 124,000~Mpc$^3$. Modeling the FRB rate as a function of
fluence, $F$, as a power law with $F^{-\alpha}$, we constrain the index $\alpha
< 2.5$ at the 90% confidence level. We discuss the implications of this result
in the context of constraints from other FRB surveys.

We derive novel constraints on millicharged dark matter and ultralight
axion-like particles using pulsar timing and fast radio burst observations.
Millicharged dark matter affects the dispersion measure of the time of arrival
of radio pulses in a way analogous to free electrons. Light pseudo-scalar dark
matter, on the other hand, causes the polarization angle of radio signals to
oscillate. We show that current and future data can set strong constraints in
both cases. For dark matter particles of charge $\epsilon e$, these constraints
are ${\epsilon}/{m_{\rm milli}} \lesssim 10^{-8}{\rm eV}^{-1}$, for masses
$m_{\rm milli}\gtrsim 10^{-6}\,$eV. For axion-like particles, the analysis of
signals from pulsars yields constraints in the axial coupling of the order of
$g/m_a\lesssim 10^{-13} {\rm GeV}^{-1}/(10^{-22}{\rm eV})$. Both bounds scale
as $(\rho/\rho_{\rm dm})^{1/2}$ if the energy density $\rho$ of the components
is a fraction of the total dark matter energy density $\rho_{\rm dm}$. We do a
detailed study of both effects using data from two samples of pulsars in the
galaxy and in globular clusters, as well as data from FRB 121102 and PSR
J0437$-$4715. We show that in both cases actual pulsar data constrain a new
region of the parameter space for these models, and will improve with future
pulsar-timing observations.

We examine how fast radio burst (FRB)-like signals predicted to be generated
during the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS) may be detected in
low-frequency radio observations triggered by the aLIGO/Virgo gravitational
wave detectors. The rapidity, directional accuracy, and sensitivity of
follow-up observations with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) are considered.
We show that with current methodology, the rapidity criteria fails for
triggered MWA observations above 136 MHz for BNS mergers within the aLIGO/Virgo
horizon, for which little dispersive delay is expected. A calculation of the
expected reduction in response time by triggering on `negative latency' alerts
from aLIGO/Virgo observations of gravitational waves generated by the BNS
inspiral is presented. This allows for observations up to 300 MHz where the
radio signal is expected to be stronger. To compensate for the poor positional
accuracy expected from these alerts, we propose a new MWA observational mode
that is capable of viewing one quarter of the sky. We show the sensitivity of
this mode is sufficient to detect an FRB-like burst from an event similar to
GW170817 if it occurred during the ongoing aLIGO/Virgo third science run (O3).

We summarize our understanding of millisecond radio bursts from an
extragalactic population of sources. FRBs occur at an extraordinary rate,
thousands per day over the entire sky with radiation energy densities at the
source about ten billion times larger than those from Galactic pulsars. We
survey FRB phenomenology, source models and host galaxies, coherent radiation
models, and the role of plasma propagation effects in burst detection. The FRB
field is guaranteed to be exciting: new telescopes will expand the sample from
the current ~80 unique burst sources (and a few secure localizations and
redshifts) to thousands, with burst localizations that enable host-galaxy
redshifts emerging directly from interferometric surveys.
  * FRBs are now established as an extragalactic phenomenon.
  * Only a few sources are known to repeat. Despite the failure to redetect
other FRBs, they are not inconsistent with all being repeaters.
  * FRB sources may be new, exotic kinds of objects or known types in extreme
circumstances. Many inventive models exist, ranging from alien spacecraft to
cosmic strings but those concerning compact objects and supermassive black
holes have gained the most attention. A rapidly rotating magnetar is a
promising explanation for FRB 121102 along with the persistent source
associated with it, but alternative source models are not ruled out for it or
other FRBs.
  * FRBs are powerful tracers of circumsource environments, `missing baryons'
in the IGM, and dark matter.
  * The relative contributions of host galaxies and the IGM to propagation
effects have yet to be disentangled, so dispersion measure distances have large
uncertainties.

We interpret recent observations of high-to-low frequency drifting features
in the spectra of the repeating FRBs as evidence of sharply changing plasma
properties in the emission region, presumably the neutron stars magnetospheres.
The drifts are then FRBs' analogues of radius-to-frequency mapping in pulsars
and Solar type-III radio burst (but not in a sense of a particular emission
mechanism). The drifts rates of $\sim 100$ MHz ms$^{-1}$ at frequencies $\sim$
GHz translate to physical size of $\sim {c \omega}/{\dot{\omega}} \sim$ few
$\times 10^8$ cm, matching the hypothesis of the FRB origin in the
magnetospheres of neutron stars. We suggest that reconnection events result in
generation of upward propagating plasma beams that produce radio emission with
frequency related to the decreasing local magnetic field and plasma density.

Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration radio pulses of extragalactic
origin. A recent statistical analysis has found that the burst energetics of
the repeating source FRB 121102 follow a power-law, with an exponent that is
curiously consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes. This hints
that repeat-bursters may be compact objects undergoing violent tectonic
activity. For young magnetars, possessing crustal magnetic fields which are
both strong ($B \gtrsim 10^{15}$ G) and highly multipolar, Hall drift can
instigate significant field rearrangements even on $\lesssim$ century long
timescales. This reconfiguration generates zones of magnetic stress throughout
the outer layers of the star, potentially strong enough to facilitate frequent
crustal failures. In this paper, assuming a quake scenario, we show how the
crustal field evolution, which determines the resulting fracture geometries,
can be tied to burst properties. Highly anisotropic stresses are generated by
the rapid evolution of multipolar fields, implying that small, localised cracks
can occur sporadically throughout the crust during the Hall evolution. Each of
these shallow fractures may release bursts of energy, consistent in magnitude
with those seen in the repeating sources FRB 121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, unresolved, millisecond-duration flashes
of radio emission originating from outside of the Milky Way. The source of
these mysterious outbursts is unknown, but their high luminosity, high
dispersion measure and short duration requires an extreme, high-energy,
astrophysical process. The majority of FRBs have been discovered as single
events which would require a chance coincidence for contemporaneous
multiwavelength observations. However, two have been observed to repeat: FRB
121102 and the recently detected FRB 180814.J0422+73. These repeating FRBs have
allowed for targeted observations by a number of different instruments,
including VERITAS. We present the VERITAS FRB observing program and the results
of these observations.

Inspiraling and merging binary neutron stars (BNSs) are important sources of
both gravitational waves and coincident electromagnetic counterparts. If the
BNS total mass is larger than a threshold value, a black hole ensues promptly
after merger. Through a statistical study in conjunction with recent LIGO/Virgo
constraints on the nuclear equation of state, we estimate that up to $\sim
25\%$ of BNS mergers may result in prompt collapse. Moreover, we find that most
models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of
prompt-collapse BNS mergers have $q\gtrsim 0.8$. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers
with mass ratio $q \gtrsim 0.8$ may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae
or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and
form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such
BNS mergers "orphan". However, recent studies have found that
${10^{41-43}(B_p/10^{12}\rm G)^2 erg\, s^{-1}}$ electromagnetic signals can be
powered by magnetospheric interactions several milliseconds prior to merger.
Moreover, the energy stored in the magnetosphere of an orphan BNS merger
remnant will be radiated away in ${\mathcal O}(1\ \rm ms)$. Through simulations
in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole
magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black
hole formation is $E_B \sim 10^{39-41} (B_p/10^{12}\rm G)^2$ erg. Radiating
$\sim 1\%$ of $E_B$ in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the
premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not
beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast
radio bursts (FRBs). These results combined with our statistical study suggest
that a non-repeating FRB may be the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of
prompt-collapse BNSs.

Although there has recently been tremendous progress in studies of fast radio
bursts (FRBs), the nature of their progenitors remains a mystery. We study the
fluence and dispersion measure (DM) distributions of the ASKAP sample to better
understand their energetics and statistics. We first consider a simplified
model of a power-law volumetric rate per unit isotropic energy dN/dE ~
E^{-gamma} with a maximum energy E_max in a uniform Euclidean Universe. This
provides analytic insights for what can be learnt from these distributions. We
find that the observed cumulative DM distribution scales as N(>DM) ~
DM^{5-2*gamma} (for gamma > 1) until a maximum value DM_max above which bursts
near E_max fall below the fluence threshold of a given telescope. Comparing
this model with the observed fluence and DM distributions, we find a reasonable
fit for gamma ~ 1.7 and E_max ~ 10^{33} erg/Hz. We then carry out a full
Bayesian analysis based on a Schechter rate function with cosmological factor.
We find roughly consistent results with our analytical approach, although with
large errors on the inferred parameters due to the small sample size. The
power-law index and the maximum energy are constrained to be gamma = 1.6 +/-
0.3 and log(E_max) [erg/Hz] = 34.1 +1.1 -0.7 (68% confidence), respectively.
From the survey exposure time, we further infer a cumulative local volumetric
rate of log N(E > 10^{32} erg/Hz) [Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}] = 2.6 +/- 0.4 (68%
confidence). The methods presented here will be useful for the much larger FRB
samples expected in the near future to study their distributions, energetics,
and rates.

We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast
radio bursts: They arise by axion star collisions with neutron stars (
accretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion star as coherent state of
axions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with
frequency $m_a/2\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons
coherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The
radiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb
the coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the
time scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra
of the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally
broaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\delta\nu$ are proportional
to their center frequencies $\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies
( $1.2$GHz$\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler
shifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On
the other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center
frequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift
also makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter.
Because the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger
than those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating
FRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields
of the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs,
which are over the extent of the receiver frequency range. The spectral
features of the recently discovered new repeating FRB 180814.J0422+75 are
coincident with our general analyses of the repeating FRB 121102.

We present a generic formalism to constrain the cosmic rate density history
and the source luminosity function of FRB progenitors from the statistical
properties of the apparent flux density of non-repeating FRBs detected with
Parkes. We include the pulse multipath propagation effects to evaluate the flux
density distribution for a generalised spatial density model and luminosity
function. We perform simulations to investigate the effects of the telescope
beam pattern and temporal resolution on the observed flux density. We find that
the FRB progenitors are likely to be younger stars with a relatively flat
energy spectrum and host galaxy DM contribution similar to the MW. Our analysis
can be extended to larger FRB samples detected with multiple surveys to place
stronger constraints on the FRB progenitor properties.

Nature of dark energy remains unknown. Especially, to constrain the time
variability of the dark-energy, a new, standardisable candle that can reach
more distant Universe has been awaited. Here we propose a new distance measure
using fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are a new emerging population of $\sim$
ms time scale radio bursts that can reach high-$z$ in quantity. We show an
empirical positive correlation between the time-integrated luminosity
(L$_{\nu}$) and rest-frame intrinsic duration ($w_{\rm int,rest}$) of FRBs. The
L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ correlation is with a weak strength but
statistically very significant, i.e., Pearson coefficient is $\sim$ 0.5 with
p-value of $\sim$0.038, despite the smallness of the current sample. This
correlation can be used to measure intrinsic luminosity of FRBs from the
observed $w_{\rm int,rest}$. By comparing the luminosity with observed flux, we
measure luminosity distances to FRBs, and thereby construct the Hubble diagram.
This FRB cosmology with the L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation has several
advantages over SNe Ia, Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and well-known FRB dispersion
measure (DM)-$z$ cosmology; (i) access to higher redshift Universe beyond the
SNe Ia, (ii) high event rate that is $\sim$ 3 order of magnitude more frequent
than GRBs, and (iii) it is free from the uncertainty from intergalactic
electron density models, i.e., we can remove the largest uncertainty in the
well-debated DM-$z$ cosmology of FRB. Our simulation suggests that the
L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation provides us with useful constraints on the
time variability of the dark energy when the next generation radio telescopes
start to find FRBs in quantity.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are milliseconds radio transients with large
dispersion measures (DMs). An outstanding question is the relation between
repeating FRBs and those with a single burst. In this paper, we study the
energy distribution of the repeating FRB 121102. For a power-law distribution
of energy $dN/dE\propto E^{-\alpha_E}$, we show that the value of $\alpha_E$ is
in a narrow range $1.6-1.8$ for bursts observed by different telescopes at
different frequencies, which indicates a universal energy distribution for FRB
121102. Interestingly, similar power-law index of energy distribution for
non-repeating FRBs observed by Parkes and ASKAP is also found. However, if
low-energy bursts below completeness threshold of Arecibo are discarded for FRB
121102, the slope could be up to 2.2. Implications of such a universal energy
distribution are discussed.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed and probably extragalactic
radio flashes with millisecond-duration. Recently, the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (using the CHIME/FRB instrument) has reported
detections of 13 FRBs during a pre-commissioning phase. It is more exciting
that one of the 13 FRBs is a second source of repeaters which suggests that
CHIME/FRB and other wide-field sensitive radio telescopes will find a
substantial population of repeating FRBs. We have proposed strongly lensed
repeating FRBs as a precision cosmological probe, e.g. constraining the Hubble
constant and model-independently estimating the cosmic curvature. Here, we
study complementary constraints on the equation of state of dark energy from
strongly lensed FRBs to currently available popular probes. It is found that,
in the framework of Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, adding time
delay measurement of 30 strongly lensed FRB systems to cosmic microwave
background radiation and type Ia supernovae can improve the dark energy figure
of merit by a factor 2. In the precision cosmology era, this improvement is of
great significance for studying the nature of dark energy.

No transient electromagnetic emission has yet been found in association to
fast radio bursts (FRBs), the only possible exception (3sigma confidence) being
the putative gamma-ray signal detected in Swift/BAT data in the energy band
15-150 keV at the time and position of FRB131104. Systematic searches for hard
X/gamma-ray counterparts to other FRBs ended up with just lower limits on the
radio/gamma-ray fluence ratios. In 2001, at the time of the earliest discovered
FRBs, the BeppoSAX Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) was one of the most sensitive
open sky gamma-ray monitors in the 40-700~keV energy band. During its lifetime,
one of the FRBs with the highest radio fluence ever recorded, FRB010724 (800 +-
400 Jy ms), also known as the Lorimer burst, was promptly visible to the GRBM.
Upon an accurate modeling of the GRBM background, eased by its equatorial
orbit, we searched for a possible gamma-ray signal in the first 400 s following
the FRB, similar to that claimed for FRB131104 and found no significant
emission down to a 5-sigma limit in the range (0.24-4.7)x10^-6 erg cm^-2
(corresponding to 1 and 400 s integration time, respectively), in the energy
band 40-700 keV. This corresponds to eta = F_radio/F_gamma>10^{8-9} Jy ms
erg^-1 cm^2, i.e. the deepest limit on the ratio between radio and gamma-ray
fluence, which rules out a gamma-ray counterpart similar to that of FRB131104.
We discuss the implications on the possible mechanisms and progenitors that
have been proposed in the literature, also taking into account its relatively
low dispersion measure (375 +- 3 pc cm^-3) and an inferred redshift limit of
z<0.4.

Searches for fast radio bursts (FRBs) are underway at a growing number of
radio telescopes worldwide. The sample size is now sufficient to enable many
investigations into the population properties. As such, understanding the true
sensitivity thresholds, effective observing time expended, survey completeness
and parameter space coverage has become vital for calibrating the observed
distributions. Recently the Molonglo FRB search team reported on their, as yet
unique, efforts to inject synthetic FRB signals into their telescope data
streams. Their results show 10 percent of injections being missed, even at very
high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Their pipeline employs components considered
standard across several telescopes so that the result is potentially alarming.
In this paper we present a further look at these missed injections. It is shown
that all of the missed injections can be explained by combinations of the noise
statistics, mis-labelling, overly harsh data analysis cuts, incorrect S/N
calculations and radio frequency interference. There is no need to be alarmed.

Intense, millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves have been detected from
beyond the Milky Way [1]. Their extragalactic origins are evidenced by their
large dispersion measures, which are greater than expected for propagation
through the Milky Way interstellar medium alone, and imply contributions from
the intergalactic medium and potentially host galaxies [2]. Although several
theories exist for the sources of these fast radio bursts, their intensities,
durations and temporal structures suggest coherent emission from highly
magnetised plasma [3,4]. Two sources have been observed to repeat [5,6], and
one repeater (FRB 121102) has been localised to the largest star-forming region
of a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19 [7, 8]. However, the host
galaxies and distances of the so far non-repeating fast radio bursts are yet to
be identified. Unlike repeating sources, these events must be observed with an
interferometer with sufficient spatial resolution for arcsecond localisation at
the time of discovery. Here we report the localisation of a fast radio burst
(FRB 190523) to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy at a
redshift of 0.66. This galaxy is in stark contrast to the host of FRB 121102,
being a thousand times more massive, with a greater than hundred times lower
specific star-formation rate. The properties of this galaxy highlight the
possibility of a channel for FRB production associated with older stellar
populations.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short duration ($\sim$millisecond) radio
transients with cosmological origin. The simple sharp features of the FRB
signal have been utilized to probe two fundamental laws of physics, namey,
testing Einstein's weak equivalence principle and constraining the rest mass of
the photon. Recently, \cite{hessels18} found that after correcting for
dispersive delay, some of the bursts in FRB 121102 have complex time-frequency
structures that include sub-pulses with a time-frequency downward drifting
property. Using the delay time between sub-pulses in FRB 121102, here we show
that the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ is the same for
photons with different energies to the level of
$\left|\gamma_1-\gamma_2\right|<2.5\times 10^{-16}$, which is 1000 times better
than previous constraints from FRBs using similar methods. We also obtain a
stringent constraint on the photon mass, $m_{\gamma} < 5.1\times10^{-48}$ g,
which is 10 times smaller than previous best limits on the photon mass derived
through the velocity dispersion method.

Recently born magnetars are promising candidates for the engines powering
fast radio bursts (FRBs). The focus thus far has been placed on millisecond
magnetars born in rare core-collapse explosions, motivated by the star forming
dwarf host galaxy of the repeating FRB 121102, which is remarkably similar to
the hosts of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long gamma-ray bursts (LGRB).
However, long-lived magnetars may also be created in binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers, in the small subset of cases with a sufficiently low total mass for
the remnant to avoid collapse to a black hole, or in the accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf. A BNS FRB channel will be characterized by
distinct host galaxy and spatial offset distributions than the SLSNe/LGRB
channel; we anticipate a similar host population, although possibly different
offset distribution for AIC events. We show that both the BNS and AIC channels
are consistent with the recently reported FRB 180924, localized by ASKAP to a
massive quiescent host galaxy with an offset of about 1.4 effective radii.
Using models calibrated to FRB 121102, we make predictions for the dispersion
measure, rotation measure, and persistent radio emission from magnetar FRB
sources born in BNS mergers or AIC, and show these are consistent with upper
limits from FRB 180924 for reasonable parameters. Depending on the rate of AIC,
and the fraction of BNS mergers leaving long-lived stable magnetars, the birth
rate of repeating FRB sources associated with older stellar populations could
be comparable to that of the core-collapse channel. We also discuss potential
differences in the repetition properties of these channels, as a result of
differences in the characteristic masses and magnetic fields of the magnetars.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are brief radio emissions from distant astronomical
sources. Some are known to repeat, but most are single bursts. Non-repeating
FRB observations have had insufficient positional accuracy to localize them to
an individual host galaxy. We report the interferometric localization of the
single pulse FRB 180924 to a position 4 kpc from the center of a luminous
galaxy at redshift 0.3214. The burst has not been observed to repeat. The
properties of the burst and its host are markedly different from the only other
accurately localized FRB source. The integrated electron column density along
the line of sight closely matches models of the intergalactic medium,
indicating that some FRBs are clean probes of the baryonic component of the
cosmic web.

We report the detection of a single burst from the first-discovered repeating
Fast Radio Burst source, FRB 121102, with CHIME/FRB, which operates in the
frequency band 400-800 MHz. The detected burst occurred on 2018 November 19 and
its emission extends down to at least 600 MHz, the lowest frequency detection
of this source yet. The burst, detected with a significance of 23.7$\sigma$,
has fluence 12$\pm$3 Jy ms and shows complex time and frequency morphology. The
34 ms width of the burst is the largest seen for this object at any frequency.
We find evidence of sub-burst structure that drifts downward in frequency at a
rate of -3.9$\pm$0.2 MHz ms$^{-1}$. Our best fit tentatively suggests a
dispersion measure of 563.6$\pm$0.5 pc cm$^{-3}$, which is ${\approx}$1% higher
than previously measured values. We set an upper limit on the scattering time
at 500 MHz of 9.6 ms, which is consistent with expectations from the
extrapolation from higher frequency data. We have exposure to the position of
FRB 121102 for a total of 11.3 hrs within the FWHM of the synthesized beams at
600 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 February 25. We estimate on the basis of this
single event an average burst rate for FRB 121102 of 0.1-10 per day in the
400-800 MHz band for a median fluence threshold of 7 Jy ms in the stated time
interval.

We analyze the statistics of pulse arrival times in fast radio burst (FRB)
121102 and demonstrate that they are remarkably similar to statistics of
magnetar high-energy short bursts. Motivated by this correspondence, we propose
that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the closed field line
zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal
slippage events dislocate field line foot points, initiating intense particle
acceleration and pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission
similar to that generated near pulsar polar caps. We argue that the energetics
of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted for if the efficiency of the conversion
of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, values
consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and
radio-loud magnetars. Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with
preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere, so that the charge density in the
closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field provoked by
the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let $\sim 1$ GHz
radio emission escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs
from known magnetars. The pair cascades crowd the closed flux tubes with
plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting the radio
pulse duration to $\sim1$ ms. Within the framework of our model, the current
dataset of the polarization angle variation in FRB 121102 suggests a magnetic
obliquity $\alpha\lesssim40^\circ$ and viewing angle $\zeta$ with respect to
the spin axis $\alpha<\zeta<180^\circ-\alpha$.

The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) project monitors two dozen millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) in order to undertake a variety of fundamental physics
experiments using the Parkes 64m radio telescope. Since June 2017 we have been
undertaking commensal searches for fast radio bursts (FRBs) during the MSP
observations. Here, we report the discovery of four FRBs (171209, 180309,
180311 and 180714). The detected events include an FRB with the highest
signal-to-noise ratio ever detected at the Parkes observatory, which exhibits
unusual spectral properties. All four FRBs are highly polarized. We discuss the
future of commensal searches for FRBs at Parkes.

FRB181228 was detected by the Molonglo Synthesis Radio Telescope (MOST) at a
position and time coincident with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
observations, representing the first simultaneous multi-wavelength data
collection for a Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The large imaged field-of-view of TESS
allows a search over the uncertainty region produced by MOST. However, the TESS
pixel scale of 21" and the Full Frame Image (FFI) cadence of 30 minutes is not
optimal for the detection of an FOB with a possible millisecond duration. We
search the TESS FFIs and find no events with a limiting TESS magnitude of 16,
assuming a 30 minute event duration, corresponding to an optical flux density
upper limit of approximately 2000 Jy for a ~ms signal duration, assuming no
signal loss. In addition, the cosmic ray mitigation method for TESS
significantly reduces its sensitivity to short timescale transients, which we
quantify. We compare our results to the predictions of Yang, Zhang, and Wei
(2019) and find that the upper limit is a factor of two thousand higher than
the predicted maximum optical flux density. However, we find that if FRB181228
had occurred in the galaxy thought to host the nearest FRB detection to date
(37 Mpc), an FOB may have been detectable by TESS. In the near future, when
CHIME and ASKAP will detect hundreds to thousands of FRBs, TESS may be able to
detect FOBs from those rare bright and nearby FRBs within this large population
(if more sophisticated cosmic ray excision can be implemented).

In this paper, we will continue to study the model of black holes coupled to
the radial flows of dark matter (RDM-stars). According to recent studies, this
model well describes the experimental Rotation Curves (RCs) of spiral galaxies,
also, RDM-stars can produce signals with the characteristics of Fast Radio
Bursts (FRBs). In this paper, we will perform a combined analysis of
experimental data on RCs and FRBs, which will allow to constrain tighter
parameters of the model. We will also show that within the framework of the
model, the Tully-Fisher relation with a slope of $ \beta = 3-4 $ can be
obtained. Further, several particular solutions will be considered: tachyonic
oven -- a solution in which the incoming flow of tachyons turns into an
outgoing flow of massive particles; shell condensate -- a naked singularity of
negative mass covered by a thin shell of positive mass, so that the
Schwarzschild solution of negative mass inside is joined to one of positive
mass outside; also, an RDM solution with a cosmological constant will be
considered. Further, in the model under consideration, Penrose diagrams will be
constructed, which share common features with Schwarzschild solutions of
positive and negative mass, whose combination the model is. The mechanism of
effective formation of negative masses in the model is discussed, which is
activated when the density of the central core exceeds the Planck value,
similarly to the previously studied quantum bounce effect.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense radio transients whose physical origin
remains unknown. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to use a
model-independent method to obtain the energy function and cosmic formation
rate directly from the observational data. Based on current samples from the
Parkes and ASKAP telecsopes, we determine, for the first time, the energy
function and formation rate of FRBs by using the Lynden-Bell $\rm C^{-}$
method. The energy function derived from the Parkes sample is a broken power
law, however it is a simple power law for the ASKAP sample. For Parkes sample,
we derive the formation rate which is roughly consistent with the star
formation rate up to $z\sim1.7$, with a local formation rate of $\dot \rho (0)
\simeq (3.2\pm 0.3)\; \times {10^4}\;{\rm{Gp}}{{\rm{c}}^{ -
3}}{\rm{y}}{{\rm{r}}^{ - 1}}$ above a detection threshold of $2\,{\rm{Jyms}}$.
For ASKAP sample, we find that the formation rate evolves much faster than the
star formation rate up to $z\sim0.7$, namely $\dot \rho (z) \propto {(1 +
z)^{6.9 \pm 1.9}}$, with a local formation rate of $\dot \rho (0) \simeq
(4.6\pm 0.8)\; \times {10^3}\;{\rm{Gp}}{{\rm{c}}^{ - 3}}{\rm{y}}{{\rm{r}}^{ -
1}}$ above a detection threshold of $51\,{\rm{Jyms}}$. This might be a
important clue for the physical origin of FRBs.

At present, we have almost as many theories to explain Fast Radio Bursts as
we have Fast Radio Bursts observed. This landscape will be changing rapidly
with CHIME/FRB, recently commissioned in Canada, and HIRAX, under construction
in South Africa. This is an opportune time to review existing theories and
their observational consequences, allowing us to efficiently curtail viable
astrophysical models as more data becomes available. In this article we provide
a currently up to date catalogue of the numerous and varied theories proposed
for Fast Radio Bursts so far. We also launch an online evolving repository for
the use and benefit of the community to dynamically update our theoretical
knowledge and discuss constraints and uses of Fast Radio Bursts.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a mysterious flash phenomenon detected in radio
wavelengths with a duration of only a few milliseconds, and they may also have
prompt gamma-ray flashes. Here we carry out a blind search for msec-duration
gamma-ray flashes using the 7-year Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT)
all-sky gamma-ray data. About 100 flash candidates are detected, but after
removing those associated with bright steady point sources, we find no flash
events at high Galactic latitude region (|b|>20 deg). Events at lower latitude
regions are consistent with statistical flukes originating from the diffuse
gamma-ray background. From these results, we place an upper limit on the GeV
gamma-ray to radio flux ratio of FRBs as xi \equiv (nu L_nu)_gamma / (nu
L_nu)_radio < 10^8, depending on the assumed FRB rate evolution. This limit is
comparable with the largest value found for pulsars, though xi of pulsars is
distributed in a wide range. We also compare this limit with the spectral
energy distribution of the 2004 giant flare of the magnetar SGR 1806-20.

We present 41 bursts from the first repeating fast radio burst discovered
(FRB 121102). A deep search has allowed us to probe unprecedentedly low burst
energies during two consecutive observations (separated by one day) using the
Arecibo telescope at 1.4 GHz. The bursts are generally detected in less than a
third of the 580-MHz observing bandwidth, demonstrating that narrow-band FRB
signals may be more common than previously thought. We show that the bursts are
likely faint versions of previously reported multi-component bursts. There is a
striking lack of bursts detected below 1.35 GHz and simultaneous VLA
observations at 3 GHz did not detect any of the 41 bursts, but did detect one
that was not seen with Arecibo, suggesting preferred radio emission frequencies
that vary with epoch. A power law approximation of the cumulative distribution
of burst energies yields an index $-1.8\pm0.3$ that is much steeper than the
previously reported value of $\sim-0.7$. The discrepancy may be evidence for a
more complex energy distribution. We place constraints on the possibility that
the associated persistent radio source is generated by the emission of many
faint bursts ($\sim700$ ms$^{-1}$). We do not see a connection between burst
fluence and wait time. The distribution of wait times follows a log-normal
distribution centered around $\sim200$ s; however, some bursts have wait times
below 1 s and as short as 26 ms, which is consistent with previous reports of a
bimodal distribution. We caution against exclusively integrating over the full
observing band during FRB searches, because this can lower signal-to-noise.

In this paper, we investigate the energy function, formation rate and
environment of fast radio bursts (FRBs) using Parkes sample and Australian
Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) sample. For the first time, the
metallicity effect on the formation rate is considered. If FRBs are produced by
the mergers of compact binaries, the formation rate of FRBs should have a time
delay relative to cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). We get the time delay is
about 3-5 Gyr and the index of differential energy function $\gamma$
($dN/dE\propto E^{-\gamma}$) is between 1.6 and 2.0 from redshift cumulative
distribution. The value of $\gamma$ is similar to that of FRB 121102, which
indicates single bursts may share the same physical mechanism with the
repeaters. In another case, if the formation rate of FRB is proportional to the
SFR without time delay, the index $\gamma$ is about 2.3. In both cases, we find
that FRBs may prefer to occur in low-metallicity environment with $ 12
+\log(\rm{O/H}) \simeq 8.40$, which is similar to those of long gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I).

A method is presented to limit the volumetric density of repeating fast radio
bursts based on the number (or lack) of repeating bursts identified in a
survey. The method incorporates the instantaneous sensitivity of the
instrument, its beam pattern, and the dwell time per pointing, as well as the
energy and timing distribution of repeat bursts. Applied to the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder's (ASKAP's) Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast
Transients (CRAFT) `lat50' survey, the presence of an FRB similar to FRB 121102
is excluded within a volume of $1.9 \cdot 10^6$ Mpc$^3$ at 95% confidence level
(C.L.). Assuming a burst energy cut-off at $10^{42}$ erg, the 95% C.L. upper
limit on the population density of repeating FRBs in the current epoch is $27$
Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming isotropic (unbeamed) emission. This number is much lower
than expected from even rare scenarios such as magnetar formation in gamma-ray
bursts. Furthermore, the maximally allowed population under-predicts the
observed number of single bursts in the survey. Comparisons with the observed
dispersion measure distribution favours a larger population of less rapidly
repeating objects, or the existence of a second population of non-repeating
FRBs. In any scenario, FRB 121102 must be an atypical object.

Radio interferometers consisting of identical antennas arranged on a regular
lattice permit fast Fourier transform beamforming, which reduces the
correlation cost from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in the number of antennas to
$\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$. We develop a formalism for describing this process and
apply this formalism to derive a number of algorithms with a range of
observational applications. These include algorithms for forming arbitrarily
pointed tied-array beams from the regularly spaced Fourier-transform formed
beams, sculpting the beams to suppress sidelobes while only losing
percent-level sensitivity, and optimally estimating the position of a detected
source from its observed brightness in the set of beams. We also discuss the
effect that correlations in the visibility-space noise, due to cross-talk and
sky contributions, have on the optimality of Fourier transform beamforming,
showing that it does not strictly preserve the sky information of the $n^2$
correlation, even for an idealized array. Our results have applications to a
number of upcoming interferometers, in particular the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment--Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project.

Until very recently we had as many theories to explain Fast Radio Bursts as
we have observations of them. An explosion of data is coming, if not here
already, and thus it is an opportune time to understand how we can use FRBs for
cosmology. The HIRAX experiment, based mostly in South Africa, will be one such
experiment, designed not only to observe large numbers of FRBs but also to
localise them. In this short article we consider briefly, some ways in which
HIRAX can change the landscape of FRB cosmology.

We report on a search for high-energy counterparts to fast radio bursts
(FRBs) with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), Fermi Large Area Telescope
(LAT), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). We
find no significant associations for any of the 23 FRBs in our sample, but
report upper limits to the high-energy fluence for each on timescales of 0.1,
1, 10, and 100 s. We report lower limits on the ratio of the radio to
high-energy fluence, $\frac{f_{r}}{f_{\gamma}}$, for timescales of 0.1 and 100
s. We discuss the implications of our non-detections on various proposed
progenitor models for FRBs, including analogs of giant pulses from the Crab
pulsar and hyperflares from magnetars. This work demonstrates the utility of
analyses of high-energy data for FRBs in tracking down the nature of these
elusive sources.

We discuss our VLA and VLBI observations of supernova 1986J, which is
characterized by a compact radio-bright component within the expanding shell of
ejecta. No other supernova (SN) has such a central component at cm wavelengths.
The central component therefore provides a unique probe of the propagation of
radio signals at cm wavelengths through the ejecta of a young SN. Such a probe
is important in the context of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB), which, in many models,
are thought to be produced by young magnetars or neutron stars. The FRB signals
would therefore have to propagate through the expanding SN ejecta. Our
observations of the Type II SN 1986J show that the ejecta would remain opaque
to cm-wave emission like FRBs for at least several decades after the explosion,
and by the time the ejecta have become transparent, the contribution of the
ejecta to the dispersion measure is likely small.

We study the polarization properties of 22 known rotating radio transients
(RRATs) with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope and present the Faraday rotation
measures (RMs) for the 17 with linearly polarized flux exceeding the off-pulse
noise by 3$\sigma$. Each RM was estimated using a brute-force search over trial
RMs that spanned the maximum measurable range $\pm1.18 \times 10^5 \,
\mathrm{rad \, m^2}$ (in steps of 1 $\mathrm{rad \, m^2}$), followed by an
iterative refinement algorithm. The measured RRAT RMs are in the range |RM|
$\sim 1$ to $\sim 950$ rad m$^{-2}$ with an average linear polarization
fraction of $\sim 40$ per cent. Individual single pulses are observed to be up
to 100 per cent linearly polarized. The RMs of the RRATs and the corresponding
inferred average magnetic fields (parallel to the line-of-sight and weighted by
the free electron density) are observed to be consistent with the Galactic
plane pulsar population. Faraday rotation analyses are typically performed on
accumulated pulsar data, for which hundreds to thousands of pulses have been
integrated, rather than on individual pulses. Therefore, we verified the
iterative refinement algorithm by performing Monte Carlo simulations of
artificial single pulses over a wide range of S/N and RM. At and above a S/N of
17 in linearly polarized flux, the iterative refinement recovers the simulated
RM value 100 per cent of the time with a typical mean uncertainty of $\sim5$
rad m$^{-2}$. The method described and validated here has also been
successfully used to determine reliable RMs of several fast radio bursts (FRBs)
discovered at Parkes.

Fruitbat is an open source Python 2/3 package for estimating redshifts,

The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still unknown. Multi-wavelength
observations during or shortly after the FRB phase would be essential to
identify the counterpart of an FRB and to constrain its progenitor and
environment. In this work, we investigate the brightness of the "fast optical
bursts" (FOBs) associated with FRBs and the prospects of detecting them. We
investigate several inverse Compton (IC) scattering processes that might
produce an FOB, including both the one-zone and two-zone models. We also
investigate the extension of the same mechanism of FRB emission to the optical
band. We find that a detectable FOB with the current and forthcoming telescopes
is possible under the IC scenarios with very special conditions. In particular,
the FRB environment would need to invoke a neutron star with an extremely
strong magnetic field and an extremely fast spin, or an extremely young
supernova remnant (SNR) surrounding the FRB source. Furthermore, most electrons
in the source are also required to have a fine-tuned energy distribution such
that most of the IC energy is channeled in the optical band. We conclude that
the prospect of detecting FOBs associated with FRBs is low. On the other hand,
if FOBs are detected from a small fraction of FRBs, these FOBs would reveal
extreme physical conditions in the FRB environments.

We describe the ongoing `Survey for Magnetars, Intermittent pulsars, Rotating
radio transients and Fast radio bursts' (SMIRF), performed using the newly
refurbished UTMOST telescope. SMIRF repeatedly sweeps the southern Galactic
plane performing real-time periodicity and single-pulse searches, and is the
first survey of its kind carried out with an interferometer. SMIRF is
facilitated by a robotic scheduler which is capable of fully autonomous
commensal operations. We report on the SMIRF observational parameters, the data
analysis methods, the survey's sensitivities to pulsars, techniques to mitigate
radio frequency interference and present some early survey results. UTMOST's
wide field of view permits a full sweep of the Galactic plane to be performed
every fortnight, two orders of magnitude faster than previous surveys. In the
six months of operations from January to June 2018, we have performed $\sim 10$
sweeps of the Galactic plane with SMIRF. Notable blind re-detections include
the magnetar PSR J1622$-$4950, the RRAT PSR J0941$-$3942 and the eclipsing
pulsar PSR J1748$-$2446A. We also report the discovery of a new pulsar, PSR
J1705$-$54. Our follow-up of this pulsar with the UTMOST and Parkes telescopes
at an average flux limit of $\leq 20$ mJy and $\leq 0.16$ mJy respectively,
categorizes this as an intermittent pulsar with a high nulling fraction of $<
0.002$

We detail a new fast radio burst (FRB) survey with the Molonglo Radio
Telescope, in which six FRBs were detected between June 2017 and December 2018.
By using a real-time FRB detection system, we captured raw voltages for five of
the six events, which allowed for coherent dedispersion and very high time
resolution (10.24 $\mu$s) studies of the bursts. Five of the FRBs show temporal
broadening consistent with interstellar and/or intergalactic scattering, with
scattering timescales ranging from 0.16 to 29.1 ms. One burst, FRB181017, shows
remarkable temporal structure, with 3 peaks each separated by 1 ms. We searched
for phase-coherence between the leading and trailing peaks and found none,
ruling out lensing scenarios. Based on this survey, we calculate an all-sky
rate at 843 MHz of $98^{+59}_{-39}$ events sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ to a fluence
limit of 8 Jy-ms: a factor of 7 below the rates estimated from the Parkes and
ASKAP telescopes at 1.4 GHz assuming the ASKAP-derived spectral index
$\alpha=-1.6$ ($F_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). Our results suggest that FRB
spectra may turn over below 1 GHz. Optical, radio and X-ray followup has been
made for most of the reported bursts, with no associated transients found. No
repeat bursts were found in the survey.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients of unknown
origin. Thus far, they have been blindly detected at millisecond timescales
with dispersion measures (DMs) between 110--2600\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. However, the
observed pulse width, DM, and even brightness distributions depend strongly on
the time and frequency resolution of the detection instrument. Spectral and
temporal resolution also significantly affect FRB detection rates, similar to
beam size and system-equivalent flux density (SEFD). I discuss the interplay
between underlying FRB properties and instrumental response, and provide a
generic formalism for calculating the \textit{observed} distributions of
parameters given an intrinsic FRB distribution, focusing on pulse width and DM.
I argue that if there exist many FRBs of duration $<<$\,1\,ms (as with giant
pulses from Galactic pulsars) or events with high DM, they are being missed due
to the deleterious effects of smearing. I outline how to optimise spectral and
temporal resolution for FRB surveys that are throughput-limited. I also
investigate how such effects may have been imprinted on the distributions of
FRBs at real telescopes, like the different observed DMs at ASKAP and Parkes.
Finally, I discuss the impact of intrinsic correlations between FRB parameters
on detection statistics.

Repeating and apparently non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRB) differ by
orders of magnitude in duty factors, energy and rotation measure. Extensive
monitoring of apparently non-repeating FRB has failed to find any repetitions.
This suggests the two types differ qualitatively, rather than in repetition
rate, and are produced by distinct kinds of sources. The absence of periodicity
in repeating FRB argues that they are not produced by neutron stars. They may
originate in dilute relativistic jets produced by low luminosity black hole
accretion. Non-repeating FRB may be produced by catastrophic events such as the
collapse of an accreting magnetic neutron star to a black hole or of an
accreting magnetic white dwarf to a neutron star, during which a disappearing
magnetic moment radiates dipole radiation that accelerates electrons in nearby
matter. If they are emitted by collimated beams of relativistic particles or
charge "bunches" with Lorentz factor $\gamma$, their radiation is collimated
into a solid angle $\sim \gamma^{-2}$ sterad, reducing the energy requirement.
If powered by magnetic reconnection, a pulse of length $\Delta t$ may draw on
the magnetic energy in a volume $\sim \gamma^4 (c \Delta t)^3$, although only a
fraction $\sim 1/\gamma^2$ of this may be dissipated without decollimation.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a novel, and relatively new approach to
analysing high-dimensional data sets. It does this by focussing on global
properties like the shape and connectivity of the data giving it a significant
advantage over more conventional tools based on cluster analysis, a localised
property of the data. However, some of its mathematical foundations, like
algebraic topology and discrete Morse theory, are perceived as an
intimidatingly steep upramp into the subject. Consequently, it has enjoyed much
less popularity as a data-analysis tool than less abstract methods. This
article aims to change this. By focusing on a small set of simple examples,
chosen primarily for their pedagogical value, we introduce and explain TDA's
two principle branches; persistent homology and the Mapper algorithm. We then
illustrate the universality of the method by discussing its application to the
intriguing data set of fast radio burst (FRB) observations. We close the
article with a discussion of the resilience of topological data analysis to
noise and some statistical and computational challenges faced by the method.

The excessive dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been
proposed to be a powerful tool to study intergalactic medium (IGM) and to
perform cosmography. One issue is that the fraction of baryons in the IGM,
$f_{\rm IGM}$, is not properly constrained. Here we propose a method of
estimating $f_{\rm IGM}$ using a putative sample of FRBs with the measurements
of both DM and luminosity distance $d_{\rm L}$. The latter can be obtained if
the FRB is associated with a distance indicator (e.g. a gamma-ray burst or a
gravitational wave event), or the redshift $z$ of the FRB is measured and
$d_{\rm L}$ at the corresponding $z$ is available from other distance
indicators (e.g. type Ia supernovae) at the same redshift. Since $d_{\rm
L}/{\rm DM}$ essentially does not depend on cosmological parameters, our method
can determine $f_{\rm IGM}$ independent of cosmological parameters. We
parameterize $f_{\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift and model the DM
contribution from a host galaxy as a function of star formation rate. Assuming
$f_{\rm IGM}$ has a mild evolution with redshift with a functional form and by
means of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an unbiased and
cosmology-independent estimate of the present value of $f_{\rm IGM}$ with a
$\sim 12\%$ uncertainty can be obtained with 50 joint measurements of $d_{\rm
L}$ and DM. In addition, such a method can also lead to a measurement of the
mean value of DM contributed from the local host galaxy.

Ofek (2017) identified FIRST J141918.9+394036 (hereafter FIRST J1419+3940) as
a radio source sharing similar properties and host galaxy type to the compact,
persistent radio source associated with the first known repeating fast radio
burst, FRB 121102. Law et al. (2018) showed that FIRST J1419+3940 is a
transient source decaying in brightness over the last few decades. One possible
interpretation is that FIRST J1419+3940 is a nearby analogue to FRB 121102 and
that the radio emission represents a young magnetar nebula (as several
scenarios assume for FRB 121102). Another interpretation is that FIRST
J1419+3940 is the afterglow of an `orphan' long gamma-ray burst (GRB). The
environment is similar to where most such events are produced. To distinguish
between these hypotheses, we conducted radio observations using the European
VLBI Network at 1.6 GHz to spatially resolve the emission and to search for
millisecond-duration radio bursts. We detect FIRST J1419+3940 as a compact
radio source with a flux density of $620 \pm 20\ \mathrm{\mu Jy}$ (on 2018
September 18) and a source size of $3.9 \pm 0.7\ \mathrm{mas}$ (i.e. $1.6 \pm
0.3\ \mathrm{pc}$ given the angular diameter distance of $83\ \mathrm{Mpc}$).
These results confirm that the radio emission is non-thermal and imply an
average expansion velocity of $(0.10 \pm 0.02)c$. Contemporaneous
high-time-resolution observations using the 100-m Effelsberg telescope detected
no millisecond-duration bursts of astrophysical origin. The source properties
and lack of short-duration bursts are consistent with a GRB jet expansion,
whereas they disfavor a magnetar birth nebula.

The newly discovered second repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source, FRB
180814.J0422+73, was reported to exhibit a time-frequency downward drifting
pattern, which is also seen in the first repeater FRB 121102. We propose a
generic geometrical model to account for the observed downward drifting of
sub-pulse frequency, within the framework of coherent curvature radiation by
bunches of electrons or positrons in the magnetosphere of a neutron star. A
sudden trigger event excites these coherent bunches of charged particles, which
stream outwards along open field lines. As the field lines sweep across the
line of sight, the bunches seen later have traveled farther into the less
curved part of the magnetic field lines, thus emitting at lower frequencies. We
use this model to explain the time-frequency downward drifting in two FRB
generation scenarios, the transient pulsar-like sparking from the inner gap
region of a slowly rotating neutron star, and the externally-triggered
magnetosphere reconfiguration known as the "cosmic comb".

The discovery of radio pulsars over a half century ago was a seminal moment
in astronomy. It demonstrated the existence of neutron stars, gave a powerful
observational tool to study them, and has allowed us to probe strong gravity,
dense matter, and the interstellar medium. More recently, pulsar surveys have
led to the serendipitous discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). While FRBs
appear similar to the individual pulses from pulsars, their large dispersive
delays suggest that they originate from far outside the Milky Way and hence are
many orders-of-magnitude more luminous. While most FRBs appear to be one-off,
perhaps cataclysmic events, two sources are now known to repeat and thus
clearly have a longer-lived central engine. Beyond understanding how they are
created, there is also the prospect of using FRBs -- as with pulsars -- to
probe the extremes of the Universe as well as the otherwise invisible
intervening medium. Such studies will be aided by the high implied all-sky
event rate: there is a detectable FRB roughly once every minute occurring
somewhere on the sky. The fact that less than a hundred FRB sources have been
discovered in the last decade is largely due to the small fields-of-view of
current radio telescopes. A new generation of wide-field instruments is now
coming online, however, and these will be capable of detecting multiple FRBs
per day. We are thus on the brink of further breakthroughs in the
short-duration radio transient phase space, which will be critical for
differentiating between the many proposed theories for the origin of FRBs. In
this review, we give an observational and theoretical introduction at a level
that is accessible to astronomers entering the field.

We present a stochastic, limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno
(LBFGS) algorithm that is suitable for handling very large amounts of data. A
direct application of this algorithm is radio interferometric calibration of
raw data at fine time and frequency resolution. Almost all existing radio
interferometric calibration algorithms assume that it is possible to fit the
dataset being calibrated into memory. Therefore, the raw data is averaged in
time and frequency to reduce its size by many orders of magnitude before
calibration is performed. However, this averaging is detrimental for the
detection of some signals of interest that have narrow bandwidth and time
duration such as fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the proposed algorithm, it is
possible to calibrate data at such a fine resolution that they cannot be
entirely loaded into memory, thus preserving such signals. As an additional
demonstration, we use the proposed algorithm for training deep neural networks
and compare the performance against the mainstream first order optimization
algorithms that are used in deep learning.

The electromagnetic signature of a point explosion near a Kerr black hole
(BH) is evaluated. The first repetitions produced by gravitational lensing are
not periodic in time; periodicity emerges only as the result of multiple
circuits of the prograde and retrograde light rings and is accompanied by
exponential dimming. Gravitational focusing creates a sequence of concentrated
caustic features and biases the detection of a repeating source toward
alignment of the BH spin with the plane of the sky. We consider the
polarization pattern in the case of emission by the Lorentz upboosting and
reflection of a magnetic field near the explosion site. Then the polarized
fraction of the detected pulse approaches unity, and rays propagating near the
equatorial plane maintain a consistent polarization direction. Near a slowly
accreting supermassive BH (SMBH), additional repetitions are caused by
reflection off annular fragments of an orbiting disk that has passed through an
ionization instability. These results are applied to the repeating fast radio
burst (FRB) source 121102, giving a concrete and predictive example of how FRB
detectability may be biased by lensing. A gravitational lensing delay of 10-30
s, and reflection delay up to $\sim 10^4$ s, are found for emission near the
innermost stable circular orbit of a $3\times 10^5\,M_\odot$ SMBH; these
effects combine to produce interesting correlations between delay time and
burst fluence. A similar repetitive pulse envelope could be seen in the
gravitational wave signal produced by a collision between compact stars near a
SMBH.

Recently, deep learning based video super-resolution (SR) methods have
achieved promising performance. To simultaneously exploit the spatial and
temporal information of videos, employing 3-dimensional (3D) convolutions is a
natural approach. However, straight utilizing 3D convolutions may lead to an
excessively high computational complexity which restricts the depth of video SR
models and thus undermine the performance. In this paper, we present a novel
fast spatio-temporal residual network (FSTRN) to adopt 3D convolutions for the
video SR task in order to enhance the performance while maintaining a low
computational load. Specifically, we propose a fast spatio-temporal residual
block (FRB) that divide each 3D filter to the product of two 3D filters, which
have considerably lower dimensions. Furthermore, we design a cross-space
residual learning that directly links the low-resolution space and the
high-resolution space, which can greatly relieve the computational burden on
the feature fusion and up-scaling parts. Extensive evaluations and comparisons
on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and
demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods.

We perform the luminosity--volume test, also known as $\langle
V/V_{MAX}\rangle$, to Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We compare the 23 FRBs,
recently discovered by ASKAP, with 20 of the FRBs found by Parkes. These
samples have different flux limits and correspond to different explored
volumes. We assume that their dispersion measure indicates their redshift and
apply the appropriate cosmological corrections to the spectrum and rate in
order to compute the $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$ for the ASKAP and Parkes
samples. For a radio spectrum of FRBs $F_\nu \propto \nu^{-1.6}$, we find
$\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle=0.66\pm 0.05$ for the ASKAP sample, that includes
FRBs up to $z=0.7$, and 0.52$\pm 0.04$ for Parkes, that extends up to $z=2.1$.
The ASKAP value suggests that the population of FRB progenitors evolves faster
than the star formation rate, while the Parkes value is consistent with it.
Even a delayed (as a power law or gaussian) star formation rate cannot
reproduce the $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$ of both samples. If FRBs do not evolve
in luminosity, the $\langle V/V_{MAX}\rangle$ values of ASKAP and Parkes sample
are consistent with a population of progenitors whose density strongly evolves
with redshift as $\sim z^{2.8}$ up to $z \sim 0.7$. We discuss possible
scenarios accounting for our results.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, as the name implies, short and intense pulses
of radiation at wavelengths of roughly one metre. FRBs have extremely high
brightness temperatures, which points to a coherent source of radiation. The
energy of a single burst ranges from $10^{36}$ to $10^{39}$ erg. At the high
end of the energy range, FRBs have enough energy to unbind an earth-sized
planet, and even at the low end, there is enough energy to vaporise and unbind
the atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of
an artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or
even destroy the planet entirely. The necessary energy can be harvested from
Wolf-Rayet stars with a Dyson sphere ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) , and the
radiation can be readily produced by astrophysical masers. We refer to this
mechanism as Volatile Amplification of a Destructive Emission of Radiation
(VADER). We use the observational information to constrain the properties of
the apparatus. We speculate that the non-repeating FRBs are low-energy pulses
used to exterminate life on a single planet, but leaving it otherwise intact,
and that the stronger repeating FRB is part of an effort to destroy multiple
objects in the same solar system, perhaps as a preventative measure against
panspermia. In this picture, the persistent synchrotron source associated with
the first repeating FRB arises from the energy harvesting process. Finally we
propose that Oumuamua might have resulted from a destruction of a planet in
this manner.

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) using conventional phased array (CPA) enables highly
directional and fixed angular beamforming (FAB), therefore enhancing physical
layer security (PLS) in the angular domain. However, as the eavesdropper is
located in the direction pointed by the mainlobe of the information-carrying
beam, information leakage is inevitable and FAB cannot guarantee PLS
performance. To address this threat, we propose a novel fixed region
beamforming (FRB) by employing a frequency diverse subarray (FDSA) architecture
to enhance the PLS performance for mmWave directional communications. In
particular, we carefully introduce multiple frequency offset increments (FOIs)
across subarrays to achieve a sophisticated beampattern synthesis that ensures
a confined information transmission only within the desired angle-range region
(DARR) in close vicinity of the target user. More specifically, we formulate
the secrecy rate maximization problem with FRB over possible subarray FOIs, and
consider two cases of interests, i.e., without/with the location information of
eavesdropping, both turn out to be NP-hard. For the unknown eavesdropping
location case, we propose a seeker optimization algorithm to minimize the
maximum sidelobe peak of the beampattern outside the DARR. As for the known
eavesdropping location case, a block coordinate descend linear approximation
algorithm is proposed to minimize the sidelobe level in the eavesdropping
region. By using the proposed FRB, the mainlobes of all subarrays are
constructively superimposed in the DARR while the sidelobes are destructively
overlayed outside the DARR. Therefore, FRB takes prominent effect on confining
information transmission within the DARR. Numerical simulations demonstrate
that the proposed FDSA-based FRB can provide superior PLS performance over the
CPA-based FAB.

The second repeating fast radio burst source, FRB 180814.J0422+73, was
detected recently by the CHIME collaboration. We use the ten-year Fermi Large
Area Telescope (LAT) archival data to place a flux upper limit in the energy
range of 100 MeV$-$10 GeV at the position of the source, which is $\sim
10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for a six-month time bin on average, and
$2.35\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the entire ten-year time span.
For the maximum redshift of $z=0.11$, the ten-year upper limit of luminosity is
$7.32\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We utilize these upper limits to constrain
the FRB progenitor and central engine. For the rotation-powered young magnetar
model, the upper limits can pose constraints on the allowed parameter space for
the initial rotational period and surface magnetic field of the magnetar. We
also place significant constraints on the kinetic energy of a relativistic
external shock wave, ruling out the possibility that there existed a gamma-ray
burst (GRB) beaming towards earth during the past ten years as the progenitor
of the repeater. The case of an off-beam GRB is also constrained if the viewing
angle is not much greater than the jet opening angle. All these constraints are
more stringent if FRB 180814.J0422+73 is at a closer distance.

After a decade of great progress in understanding gas flow into, out of, and
through the Milky Way, we are poised to merge observations with simulations to
build a comprehensive picture of the multi-scale magnetized interstellar medium
(ISM). These insights will also be crucial to four bold initiatives in the
2020s: detecting nanohertz gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays
(PTAs), decoding fast radio bursts (FRBs), cosmic B-mode detection, and imaging
the Milky Way's black hole with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

We describe the design and deployment of GREENBURST, a commensal Fast Radio
Burst (FRB) search system at the Green Bank Telescope. GREENBURST uses the
dedicated L-band receiver tap to search over the 960$-$1920 MHz frequency range
for pulses with dispersion measures out to $10^4$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Due to its
unique design, GREENBURST will obtain data even when the L-band receiver is not
being used for scheduled observing. This makes it a sensitive single pixel
detector capable of reaching deeper in the radio sky. While single pulses from
Galactic pulsars and rotating radio transients will be detectable in our
observations, and will form part of the database we archive, the primary goal
is to detect and study FRBs. Based on recent determinations of the all-sky
rate, we predict that the system will detect approximately one FRB for every
2$-$3 months of continuous operation. The high sensitivity of GREENBURST means
that it will also be able to probe the slope of the FRB source function, which
is currently uncertain in this observing band.

We have conducted a search for bright repeating Fast Radio Bursts in our
nearby Universe with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)
in single-dish mode. We used eight ASKAP 12-m dishes, each equipped with a
Chequerboard Phased Array Feed forming 36 beams on the sky, to survey
$\sim$30,000 deg$^{2}$ of the southern sky ($-90^{\circ} < \delta <
+30^{\circ}$) in 158 antenna days. The fluence limit of the survey is 22 Jyms.
We report the detection of FRB 180515 in our survey. We found no repeating FRBs
in a total mean observation of 3hrs per pointing divided into one-hour
intervals, which were separated in time ranging between a day to a month. Using
our non-detection, we exclude the presence of a repeating FRB similar to FRB
121102 closer than $z=0.004$ in the survey area --- a volume of at least $9.4
\times 10^4$Mpc$^3$ --- at 95% confidence.

The discovery of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances has
opened a powerful window on otherwise unseen matter in the Universe. In the
2020s, observations of $>10^{4}$ FRBs will assess the baryon contents and
physical conditions in the hot/diffuse circumgalactic, intracluster, and
intergalactic medium, and test extant compact-object dark matter models.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01866v2
Fast radio bursts (FRB) can arise from synchrotron maser emission at
ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks, such as produced by flare ejecta from
young magnetars. We combine PIC simulation results for the synchrotron maser
with the dynamics of self-similar shock deceleration, as commonly applied to
GRBs, to explore the implications for FRB emission. We assume the upstream
environment into which the ultra-relativistic ejecta collides is a mildly
relativistic baryon-loaded shell released following a previous flare, motivated
by the high electron-ion injection rate Mdot ~ 1e19-1e21 g/s needed on larger
scales to power the persistent radio nebula coincident with the repeating
burster FRB 121102 and its high inferred rotation measure. The observed radio
fluence peaks once the optical depth ahead of the shock to induced Compton
scattering decreases to <~ few, a condition which places a GHz observer on the
high frequency tail of the maser SED. Given intervals between ion shell
ejection events ~1e5 s similar to the occurrence rate of the most powerful
bursts from FRB 121102, we demonstrate the production of FRBs of frequency ~
0.1-10 GHz, isotropic radiated energies ~1e37-1e40 erg and durations ~0.1-10 ms
for flares of energy ~1e43-1e45 erg. Deceleration of the blast wave, and
increasing transparency of the upstream medium, generates a temporal decay of
the peak frequency, similar to the downward drift seen in the sub-bursts of FRB
121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73. The delay >~ 1e5 s between major ion-injection
events needed to clear sufficiently low densities around the engine for FRB
emission could explain prolonged "dark" periods and clustered burst arrival
times, and lead to stochastic variation in the dispersion measure. Thermal
electrons heated at the shock generate a short-lived <~ 1 ms (1 s) synchrotron
transient at gamma-ray (X-ray) energies, analogous to a GRB afterglow.

We report the results from a survey of the Galactic plane for dispersed
single pulses using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). We searched for rare
bright dispersed radio pulses comprising 160 pointings covering 4800 deg$^2$ of
the Galactic plane within |b| $< 7 \deg$, each pointing with an exposure time
of 10 hours. We detected one fast radio burst, FRB 180430, and single pulses
from 11 pulsars. No rotating radio transients were detected. We detected FRB
180430 in the Galactic plane in the anticentre direction with a fluence of
216$\pm5$Jy ms a dispersion measure (DM) of 264.1 pc cm-3. We estimate the
extragalactic DM of the object to be less than 86.7 $ \text{pc} \
\text{cm}^{-3} $ depending on the electron density model. One model suggests
that this FRB may be a giant pulse within our galaxy; we discuss how this may
not correctly represent the line-of-sight DM. Based on the single detection of
FRB 180430 in 3.47 $\times 10^{4}$ deg$^2$ h we derive a FRB event rate in the
Galactic plane at the 20 Jy ms threshold to be in the range 2-140 per sky per
day at 95% confidence. Despite the necessarily large uncertainties from this
single detection, this is consistent with the current ASKAP all-sky detection
rate.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08933v4
In our previous work, we propose a cross spectrum based method to extract
single pulse signals from RFI contaminated data, which is originated from
geodetic VLBI postprocessing. This method fully utilizes fringe phase
information of the cross spectrum and hence maximizes signal power, however the
localization was not discussed in that work yet. As the continuation of that
work, in this paper, we further study how to localize single pulses using
astrometric solving method. Assuming that the burst is a point source, we
derive the burst position by solving a set of linear equations given the
relation between residual delay and offset to a priori position. We find that
the single pulse localization results given by both astrometric solving and
radio imaging are consistent within 3 sigma level. Therefore we claim that it
is possible to derive the position of a single pulse with reasonable precision
based on only 3 or even 2 baselines with 4 milliseconds integration. The
combination of cross spectrum based detection and the localization proposed in
this work then provide a thorough solution for searching single pulse in VLBI
observation. According to our calculation, our pipeline gives comparable
accuracy as radio imaging pipeline. Moreover, the computational cost of our
pipeline is much smaller, which makes it more practical for FRB search in
regular VLBI observation. The pipeline is now publicly available and we name it
as "VOLKS", which is the acronym of "VLBI Observation for frb Localization Keen
Searcher".

The emission process of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) remains unknown. We
investigate whether the synchrotron maser emission from relativistic shocks in
a magnetar wind can explain the observed FRB properties. We perform
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of perpendicular shocks in cold pair
plasmas, checking our results for consistency among three PIC codes. We confirm
that a linearly polarized X-mode wave is self-consistently generated by the
shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor wave. We find that at
magnetizations $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., ratio of Poynting flux to particle
energy flux of the pre-shock flow) the shock converts a fraction $f_\xi'
\approx 7 \times 10^{-4}/\sigma^2$ of the total incoming energy into the
precursor wave, as measured in the shock frame. The wave spectrum is
narrow-band (fractional width $\lesssim 1-3$), with apparent but not dominant
line-like features as many resonances concurrently contribute. The peak
frequency in the pre-shock (observer) frame is $\omega^{\prime \prime}_{\rm
peak} \approx 3 \gamma_{\rm s | u} \omega_{\rm p}$, where $\gamma_{\rm s|u}$ is
the shock Lorentz factor in the upstream frame and $\omega_{\rm p}$ the plasma
frequency. At $\sigma\gtrsim1$, where our estimated $\omega''_{\rm peak}$
differs from previous works, the shock structure presents two solitons
separated by a cavity, and the peak frequency corresponds to an eigenmode of
the cavity. Our results provide physically-grounded inputs for FRB emission
models within the magnetar scenario.

We investigate the performance of the generalized Spectral Kurtosis (SK)
estimator in detecting and discriminating natural and artificial very short
duration transients in the 2-bit sampling time domain Very-Long-Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) data. We demonstrate that, while both types of transients
may be efficiently detected, their natural or artificial nature cannot be
distinguished if only a time domain SK analysis is performed. However, these
two types of transients become distinguishable from each other in the spectral
domain, after a 32-bit FFT operation is performed on the 2-bit time domain
voltages. We discuss the implication of these findings on the ability of the
Spectral Kurtosis estimator to automatically detect bright astronomical
transient signals of interests -- such as pulsar or fast radio bursts (FRB) --
in VLBI data streams that have been severely contaminated by unwanted radio
frequency interference.

Recently Zhang et al. (2019) reported the discovery of FRB 010312 in a
dataset previously searched for FRBs. Here we explain how and why this FRB was
initially missed, and highlight several caveats relevant to FRB search
completeness. It is possible that up to $\sim40$% of discoverable FRBs remain
undiscovered in some existing public domain archival data sets. The situation
could be even more pronounced given that FRB search pipelines generally look
for temporally-symmetric broadband flat-spectrum pulses; most FRBs do not look
like that.

The distances to fast radio bursts (FRBs) are crucial for understanding their
underlying engine, and for their use as cosmological probes. In this paper, we
provide three statistical estimates of the distance to ASKAP FRBs. First, we
show that the number of events of similar luminosity in ASKAP does not scale as
distance cubed, as one would expect, when directly using the observed
dispersion measure (DM) to infer distance. Second, by comparing the average DMs
of FRBs observed with different instruments, we estimated the average redshift
of ASKAP FRBs to be $z\sim 0.01$ using CHIME and ASKAP, and $z\lesssim0.07$
using Parkes and ASKAP. Both values are much smaller than the upper limit
$z\sim0.3$ estimated directly from the DM. Third, we cross-correlate the
locations of the ASKAP FRBs with existing large-area redshift surveys, and see
a 3$\sigma$ correlation with the 2MASS Redshift Survey and a 5$\sigma$
correlation with the HI Parkes All Sky Survey at $z\sim0.007$. This corresponds
well with the redshift of the most likely host galaxy of ASKAP FRB 171020,
which is at $z=0.00867$. These arguments combined suggest an extremely nearby
origin of ASKAP FRBs and a local environment with accumulated electrons that
contribute a DM of several hundred pc/cm$^3$, which should be accounted for in
theoretical models.

The discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs) about a decade ago opened up new
possibilities for probing the ionization history of the Intergalactic Medium
(IGM). In this paper we study the use of FRBs for tracing the epoch of HeII
reionization, using simulations of their dispersion measures. We model
dispersion measure contributions from the Milky Way, the IGM (homogeneous and
inhomogeneous) and a possible host galaxy as a function of redshift and star
formation rate. We estimate the number of FRBs required to distinguish between
a model of the Universe in which helium reionization occurred at z = 3 from a
model in which it occurred at z = 6 using a 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test.
We find that if the IGM is homogeneous >1100 FRBs are needed and that an
inhomogeneous model in which traversal of the FRB pulse through galaxy halos
increases the number of FRBs modestly, to >1600. We also find that to
distinguish between a reionization that occurred at z = 3 or z = 3.5 requires
~5700 FRBs in the range 3 < z < 5.

We report the discovery of a new fast radio burst (FRB), FRB~010312, in
archival data from a 1.4\,GHz survey of the Magellanic Clouds using the
multibeam receiver on the Parkes 64\,m-diameter radio telescope. These data
sets include the Lorimer burst (FRB~010724), which it pre-dates and which we
also re-detect. The new burst has a much higher dispersion measure of
1187\,cm$^{-3}$pc. The burst is one of the broadest found to date, the second
earliest FRB known, and the ninth FRB discovered with a dispersion measure
larger than 1000\,cm$^{-3}\,$pc. Our discovery indicates that there are likely
to be more burst events still to be found in the existing Parkes data archive.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05203v1
The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still a mystery. One model proposed
to interpret the only known repeating object, FRB 121102, is that the radio
emission is generated from asteroids colliding with a highly magnetized neutron
star (NS). With N-body simulations, we model a debris disc around a central
star with an eccentric orbit intruding NS. As the NS approaches the first
periastron passage, most of the comets are scattered away rather than being
accreted by the NS. To match the observed FRB rate, the debris belt would have
to be at least three orders of magnitude more dense than the Kuiper belt. We
also consider the rate of collisions on to the central object but find that the
density of the debris belt must be at least four orders of magnitude more dense
than the Kuiper belt. These discrepancies in the density arise even if (1) one
introduces a Kuiper-belt like comet belt rather than an asteroid belt and
assume that comet impacts can also make FRBs; (2) the NS moves 2 orders of
magnitude slower than their normal proper-motion velocity due to supernova
kicks; and (3) the NS orbit is coplanar to the debris belt, which provides the
highest rate of collisions.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02352v2
We explore the possibility that the Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are powered by
magnetic reconnection in magnetars, triggered by Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark
matter. In this model, the magnetic reconnection is ignited by the shock wave
which develops when the nuggets' Mach number $M \gg 1$. These shock waves
generate very strong and very short impulses expressed in terms of pressure
$\Delta p/p\sim M^2$ and temperature $\Delta T/T\sim M^2$ in the vicinity of
(would be) magnetic reconnection area. We find that the proposed mechanism
produces a coherent emission which is consistent with current data, in
particular the FRB energy requirements, the observed energy distribution, the
frequency range and the burst duration. Our model allows us to propose
additional tests which future data will be able to challenge.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01779v1
While repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain scarce in number, they
provide a unique opportunity for follow-up observations that enhance our
knowledge of their sources and potentially of the FRB population as a whole.
Attaining more burst spectra could lead to a better understanding of the origin
of these bright, millisecond-duration radio pulses. We therefore performed
$\sim$20 hr of simultaneous observations on FRB 121102 with the Effelsberg
100-m radio telescope and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to constrain the
spectral behaviour of bursts from FRB 121102 at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz. This
campaign resulted in the detection of nine new bursts at 1.4 GHz but no
simultaneous detections with LOFAR. Assuming that the ratio of the fluence at
two frequencies scales as a power law, we placed a lower limit of $\alpha$ >
-1.2 $\pm$ 0.4 on the spectral index for the fluence of the instantaneous broad
band emission of FRB 121102. For the derivation of this limit, a realistic
fluence detection threshold for LOFAR was determined empirically assuming a
burst would be scattered as predicted by the NE2001 model. A significant
variation was observed in the burst repeat rate R at L-band. During
observations in September 2016, nine bursts were detected, giving R = 1.1 $\pm$
0.4 hr$^{-1}$, while in November no bursts were detected, yielding R < 0.3
hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit). This variation is consistent with earlier
seen episodic emission of FRB 121102. In a blind and targeted search, no bursts
were found with LOFAR at 150 MHz, resulting in a repeat rate limit of R < 0.16
hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit). Burst repeat rate ratios of FRB 121102 at 3,
2, 1.4, and 0.15 GHz are consistent within the uncertainties with a flattening
of its spectrum below 1 GHz.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00272v1
We present Monte-Carlo simulations of a cosmological population of repeating
fast radio burst (FRB) sources whose comoving density follows the cosmic star
formation rate history. We assume a power-law model for the intrinsic energy
distribution for each repeating FRB source located at a randomly chosen
position in the sky and simulate their dispersion measures (DMs) and
propagation effects along the chosen lines-of-sight to various telescopes. In
one scenario, an exponential distribution for the intrinsic wait times between
pulses is chosen, and in a second scenario we model the observed pulse arrival
times to follow a Weibull distribution. For both models we determine whether
the FRB source would be deemed a repeater based on the telescope sensitivity
and time spent on follow-up observations. We are unable to rule out the
existence of a single FRB population based on comparisons of our simulations
with the longest FRB follow-up observations performed. We however rule out the
possibility of FRBs 171020 and 010724 repeating with the same rate statistics
as FRB 121102 and also constrain the slope of a power-law fit to the FRB energy
distribution to be $-2.0 < \gamma <-1.0$. All-sky simulations of repeating FRB
sources imply that the detection of singular events correspond to the bright
tail-end of the adopted energy distribution due to the combination of the
increase in volume probed with distance, and the position of the burst in the
telescope beam.

The precise localization (<1'') of multiple fast radio bursts (FRBs) to z>0.1
galaxies has confirmed that the dispersion measures (DMs) of these enigmatic
sources afford a new opportunity to probe the diffuse ionized gas around and in
between galaxies. In this manuscript, we examine the signatures of gas in dark
matter halos (aka halo gas) on DM observations in current and forthcoming FRB
surveys. Combining constraints from observations of the high velocity clouds,
OVII absorption, and the DM to the Large Magellanic Cloud with hydrostatic
models of halo gas, we estimate that our Galactic halo will contribute ${\rm
DM}_{\rm MW,halo} \approx 50-80 \rm pc/cm^{-3}$ from the Sun to 200 kpc
independent of any contribution from the Galactic ISM. Extending analysis to
the Local Group, we demonstrate that M31's halo will be easily detected by
high-sample FRB surveys (e.g. CHIME) although signatures from a putative Local
Group medium may compete. We then review current empirical constraints on halo
gas in distant galaxies and discuss the implications for their DM
contributions. We further examine the DM probability distribution function of a
population of FRBs at z >> 0 using an updated halo mass function and new models
for the halo density profile. Lastly, we illustrate the potential of FRB
experiments for resolving the baryonic fraction of halos by analyzing simulated
sightlines through the CASBaH survey. All of the code and data products of our
analysis are available at https://github.com/FRBs.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient sources that emit a single radio pulse
with a duration of only a few milliseconds. Since the discovery of the first
FRB in 2007, tens of similar events have been detected. However, their physical
origin remains unclear, and a number of scenarios even larger than the number
of known FRBs has been proposed during these years. The presence of repeating
bursts in FRB 121102 allowed us to perform a precise localization of the source
with the Very Large Array and the European VLBI Network (EVN). Optical
observations with Keck, Gemini and HST unveiled the host to be a
low-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxy located at a redshift of 0.193. The
EVN results showed that the bursts are co-located (within a projected
separation of $< 40$ pc) to a compact and persistent radio source with a size
of $< 0.7$ pc inside a star-forming region. This environment resembles the ones
where superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long gamma-ray bursts are produced.
Although the nature of this persistent source and the origin of the bursts
remain unknown, scenarios considering a pulsar/magnetar energizing a young
SLSN, or a system with a pulsar/magnetar in the vicinity of a massive black
hole are the most plausible ones to date. More recent observations have shown
that the bursts from FRB 121102 are almost 100% linearly polarized at an
unexpectedly high and variable Faraday rotation measure, that has been observed
to date only in vicinities of massive black holes. The bursts are thus likely
produced from a neutron star in such environment, although the system can still
be explained by a young neutron star embedded in a highly magnetized nebula.
Upcoming interferometric searches are expected to report tens of these
localizations in the coming years, unveil if this source is representative of
the whole population or a particular case, and dramatically boosting the field
of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06430v2
In this work, we consider the possibility of energy release in pulsar
magnetospheres deformed by gravitational waves from nearby sources. The strong
electromagnetic fields in the magnetospheres may release non-negligible energy
despite the weakness of the gravitational wave. When the background spacetime
is perturbed due to the passage of a gravitational wave, the original
force-free state of the inner magnetosphere will be slightly violated. The
plasma-filled magnetosphere tends to evolve into new force-free states as the
spacetime varies with time. During this process, a small portion of the
electromagnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere will be released to the
acceleration of charged particles along the magnetic field lines. When the
pulsar is close enough to the gravitational wave source (e.g., $\sim10^{-2}$ pc
to the gravitational wave sources observed recently), the resulting energy loss
rate is comparable with the radio luminosity of the pulsar. It is also noticed
that, under very stringent conditions (for magnetars with much shorter distance
to the sources), the released energy can reach the typical energy observed from
fast radio bursts (FRBs).

Here, we report on the detection and verification of Fast Radio Burst FRB
180301, which occurred on UTC 2018 March 1 during the Breakthrough Listen
observations with the Parkes telescope. Full-polarization voltage data of the
detection were captured--a first for non-repeating FRBs--allowing for coherent
de-dispersion and additional verification tests. The coherently de-dispersed
dynamic spectrum of FRB 180301 shows complex, polarized frequency structure
over a small fractional bandwidth. As FRB 180301 was detected close to the
geosynchronous satellite band during a time of known 1-2 GHz satellite
transmissions, we consider whether the burst was due to radio interference
emitted or reflected from an orbiting object. Based on the preponderance of our
verification tests, we find that FRB 180301 is likely of astrophysical origin,
but caution that anthropogenic sources cannot conclusively be ruled out.

Birefringence in ionized, magnetized media is usually measured as Faraday
rotation of linearly polarized radiation. However, pulses propagating through
regions with very large Faraday rotation measures (RMs) can split into
circularly polarized components with measurable differences in arrival times
$\propto \nu^{-3}\, \rm RM$, where $\nu$ is the radio frequency. Differential
refraction from gradients in DM (dispersion measure) and RM can contribute a
splitting time $\propto \vert \mathbf{\nabla_{\perp}} \rm DM \vert \vert
\mathbf{\nabla_{\perp}}\rm RM \vert\,\nu^{-5}$. Regardless of whether the
emitted pulse is unpolarized or linearly polarized, net circular polarization
will be measured when splitting is a significant fraction of the pulse width.
However, the initial polarization may be inferable from the noise statistics of
the bursts. Extreme multipath scattering that broadens pulses can mask
splitting effects. We discuss particular cases such as the Galactic center
magnetar, J1749$-$2900, and the repeating fast radio burst source, FRB 121102.
Both lines of sight have $\rm RM \sim 10^5~\rm rad~m^{-2}$ that yields
millisecond splittings at frequencies well below $\sim 1 \text{ GHz}$. We also
consider the splitting of nanosecond shot pulses in giant pulses from the Crab
pulsar and the minimal effects of birefringence on precision pulsar timing.
Finally, we explore the utility of two-dimensional coherent dedispersion with
DM and RM as parameters.

Since January 2017, the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey
(CRAFT) has been utilising commissioning antennas of the Australian SKA
Pathfinder (ASKAP) to survey for fast radio bursts (FRBs) in fly's eye mode.
This is the first extensive astronomical survey using phased array feeds
(PAFs), and a total of 20 FRBs have been reported. Here we present a
calculation of the sensitivity and total exposure of this survey, using the
pulsars B1641-45 (J1644-4559) and B0833-45 (J0835-4510, i.e.\ Vela) as
calibrators. The design of the survey allows us to benchmark effects due to PAF
beamshape, antenna-dependent system noise, radio-frequency interference, and
fluctuations during commissioning on timescales from one hour to a year.
Observation time, solid-angle, and search efficiency are calculated as a
function of FRB fluence threshold. Using this metric, effective survey
exposures and sensitivities are calculated as a function of the source counts
distribution. The implied FRB rate is significantly lower than the
$37$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ calculated using nominal exposures and
sensitivities for this same sample by \citet{craft_nature}. At the Euclidean
power-law index of $-1.5$, the rate is $10.7_{-1.8}^{+2.7}\,{\rm (sys)} \, \pm
\, 3\,{\rm (stat)}$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ above a threshold of $57\pm6\,{\rm
(sys)}$\,Jy\,ms, while for the best-fit index for this sample of $-2.1$, it is

The extreme, time-variable Faraday rotation observed in the repeating fast
radio burst (FRB) 121102 and its associated persistent synchrotron source
demonstrates that some FRBs originate in dense, dynamic and possibly
relativistic magneto-ionic environments. Here we show that besides rotation of
the linear-polarisation vector (Faraday rotation), such media can generally
convert linear to circular polarisation (Faraday conversion). We use
non-detection of Faraday conversion, and the temporal variation in Faraday
rotation and dispersion in bursts from FRB\,121102 to constrain models where
the progenitor inflates a relativistic nebula (persistent source) confined by a
cold dense medium (e.g. supernova ejecta). We find that the persistent
synchrotron source, if composed of an electron-proton plasma, must be an
admixture of relativistic and non-relativistic (Lorentz factor $\gamma<5$)
electrons. Furthermore we independently constrain the magnetic field in the
cold confining medium, which provides the Faraday rotation, to be between $10$
and $30\,$mG. This value is close to the equipartition magnetic field of the
confined persistent source implying a self-consistent and over-constrained
model that can explain the observations.

The discovery of a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) source, FRB 121102,
eliminated models involving cataclysmic events for this source. No other
repeating FRB has yet been detected in spite of many recent FRB discoveries and
follow-ups, suggesting repeaters may be rare in the FRB population. Here we
report the detection of six repeat bursts from FRB 180814.J0422+73, one of the
13 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
FRB project during its pre-commissioning phase in July and August 2018. These
repeat bursts are consistent with originating from a single position on the
sky, with the same dispersion measure (DM), ~189 pc cm-3. This DM is
approximately twice the expected Milky Way column density, and implies an upper
limit on the source redshift of 0.1, at least a factor of ~2 closer than FRB
121102. In some of the repeat bursts, we observe sub-pulse frequency structure,
drifting, and spectral variation reminiscent of that seen in FRB 121102,
suggesting similar emission mechanisms and/or propagation effects. This second
repeater, found among the first few CHIME/FRB discoveries, suggests that there
exists -- and that CHIME/FRB and other wide-field, sensitive radio telescopes
will find -- a substantial population of repeating FRBs.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed millisecond-duration radio
flashes likely arriving from far outside the Milky Way galaxy. This phenomenon
was discovered at radio frequencies near 1.4 GHz and to date has been observed
in one case at as high as 8 GHz, but not below 700 MHz in spite of significant
searches at low frequencies. Here we report detections of FRBs at radio
frequencies as low as 400 MHz, on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) using the CHIME/FRB instrument. We present 13 FRBs detected
during a telescope pre-commissioning phase, when our sensitivity and
field-of-view were not yet at design specifications. Emission in multiple
events is seen down to 400 MHz, the lowest radio frequency to which we are
sensitive. The FRBs show a variety of temporal scattering behaviours, with the
majority significantly scattered, and some apparently unscattered to within
measurement uncertainty even at our lowest frequencies. Of the 13 reported
here, one event has the lowest dispersion measure yet reported, implying it is
among the closest yet known, and another has shown multiple repeat bursts, as
described in a companion paper. Our low-scattering events suggest that efforts
to detect FRBs at radio frequencies below 400 MHz will eventually be
successful. The overall scattering properties of our sample suggest that FRBs
as a class are preferentially located in environments that scatter radio waves
more strongly than the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way.

Currently, FRB 121102 is the only fast radio burst source that was observed
to give out bursts repeatedly. It shows a high repeating rate, with more than
one hundred bursts being spotted, but with no obvious periodicity in the
activities. Thanks to its repetition, the source was well localized with a
subarcsecond accuracy, leading to a redshift measurement of about 0.2. FRB
121102 is a unique source that can help us understand the enigmatic nature of
fast radio bursts. In this study, we analyze the characteristics of the waiting
times between bursts from FRB 121102. It is found that there is a clear bimodal
distribution for the waiting times. While most waiting times cluster at several
hundred seconds, a small portion of the waiting times are strikingly in the
range of 2--40 millisecond. More interestingly, it is found that the waiting
time does not correlate with the burst intensity, either for the preceding
burst or for the subsequent burst. It strongly indicates that the repeating
bursts should be generated by some external mechanisms, but not internal
mechanisms. As a result, the models involving collisions between small bodies
and neutron stars could be competitive mechanisms for this interesting source.

In this work we consider a recently formulated model of a black hole coupled
with radially directed flows of dark matter (RDM-star). In this model, a cutoff
by quantum gravity (QG) creates a core of Planck density, filled with a gas of
Planck mass particles, inside the star.
  Further, in this model, a fast radio burst (FRB) can be generated via the
following mechanism. An object of an asteroid mass falls onto an RDM-star. Due
to large gravitational forces available in the interior, the RDM-star works as
a powerful accelerator, boosting the nucleons composing the object to extremely
high energies. Upon collision with the core, the nucleons enter in deeply
inelastic reactions with the Planck particles composing the core. This process
is followed by stimulated emission of highly energetic photons. On the way
outside, these photons are subjected to a strong redshift factor, downscaling
their frequencies to the radio diapason, as a result producing an FRB.
  A straightforward computation gives a characteristic upper FRB frequency of
0.6GHz. With attenuation factors, it is stretched to a range 0.35-8GHz, fitting
well with the observable FRB frequencies. We also discuss the reconstruction of
other FRB parameters in frames of the model.

We consider future cosmological tests based on observations of Fast Radio
Bursts (FRBs). We use Illustris Simulation to realistically estimate the
scatter in the dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs caused by the inhomogeneous
distribution of ionized gas in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We find ~13%
scatter in DM to a source at z=1 and ~7% at z=3 (one sigma). The distribution
of DM is close to Gaussian. We simulate samples of FRBs and examine their
applicability to simple cosmological tests. Our calculations show that using a
sample of 100 FRBs and fixing cosmological model one can find the redshift and
sample averaged fraction of ionized gas with ~1% uncertainty. Finding the
ionized fraction with ~1% accuracy at few different epochs would require ~10
000 FRBs with known redshifts. Because DM is proportional to the product of
ionized fraction, baryon density and the Hubble constant it is impossible to
constrain these parameters separately with FRBs. Constraints on cosmological
densities are possible in a flat LCDM model but give uninterestingly low
accuracy. Using FRBs with other type of data improves the constraints, but the
role of FRBs is not crucial. Thus constraints on the distribution of ionized
gas are probably the most promising application of FRBs which allow for
"tomography" if sources redshifts are known, as opposed to measuring electron
scattering optical depth or S-Z y parameters with CMB observations.

Results of a search for individual impulsive signals on the Large Scanning
Antenna of the Lebedev Physical Institute at 111 MHz carried out from July 2012
through May 2018 are presented. The data were convolved with a template of a
specified form and convolved with a test dispersion measure. A region of sky
with central coordinates $\alpha = 05^h 32^m;$ $\delta = +41.72^\circ$ and also
a region of sky around the coordinates fixed earlier for FRB 121102 ($\alpha =
05^h 32^m;$ $\delta = +33.1^\circ$) were chosen for the analysis. In all, 355
hours of observations were processed for each beam. Three radio bursts with
dispersion measures of $247$ $pc \cdot cm^{-3}$, $570$ $ pc \cdot cm^{-3}$,
$1767$ $ pc \cdot cm^{-3}$ were detected in the course of reducing the data.

In this paper we propose the model that the coalescence of primordial black
holes (PBHs) binaries with equal mass $M \sim 10^{28}$g can emit luminous
gigahertz (GHz) radio transient, which may be candidate sources for the
observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), if at least one black hole holds appropriate
amount of net electric charge $Q$. Using a dimensionless quantity for the
charge $q = Q/\sqrt{G}M$, our analyses infer that $q\sim O(10^{-4.5})$ can
explain the FRBs with released energy of order $O(10^{40}) {\rm ergs}$. With
the current sample of FRBs and assuming a distribution of charge $\phi(q)$ for
all PBHs, we can deduce that its form is proportional to $q^{-3.0\pm0.1}$ for
$q\geq 7.2\times10^{-5}$ if PBHs are sources of the observed FRBs. Furthermore,
with the proposed hypothetical scenario and by estimating the local event rate
of FRBs $\sim 2.6 \times 10^3 {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$, one derives a
lower bound for the fraction of PBHs (at the mass of $10^{28}$g) against that
of matter $f_{\rm PBH}(10^{28}{\rm g})$ $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ needed to explain the
rate. With this inspiring estimate, we expect that future observations of FRBs
can help to falsify their physical origins from the PBH binaries coalescences.
In the future, the gravitational waves produced by mergers of small black holes
can be detected by high frequency gravitational wave detectors. We believe that
this work would be a useful addition to the current literature on
multimessenger astronomy and cosmology.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short duration highly energetic dispersed radio
pulses. We developed a generic formalism (Bera {\em et al.}, 2016) to estimate
the FRB detection rate for any radio telescope with given parameters. By using
this model, we estimated the FRB detection rate for two Indian radio telescope;
the Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA) (Bhattacharyya {\em et al.}, 2017) and the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) (Bhattacharyya {\em et al.},
2018) with three beam forming modes. In this review article, I summarize these
two works. We considered the energy spectrum of FRBs as a power law and the
energy distribution of FRBs as a Dirac delta function and a Schechter
luminosity function. We also considered two scattering models proposed by Bhat
{\em et al.} (2004) and Macquart \& Koay (2013) for these work and I consider
FRB pulse without scattering as a special case for this review. We found that
the future prospects of detecting FRBs by using these two Indian radio
telescopes is good. They are capable to detect a significant number of FRBs per
day. According to our prediction, we can detect $\sim 10^5-10^8$, $\sim
10^3-10^6$ and $\sim 10^5-10^7$ FRBs per day by using OWFA, commensal systems
of GMRT and uGMRT respectively. Even a non detection of the predicted events
will be very useful in constraining FRB properties.

The aim of this white paper is to discuss the observing strategies for the
LSST Wide-Fast-Deep that would improve the study of blazars (emission
variability, census, environment) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). For blazars,
these include the adoption of: i) a reference filter to allow reconstruction of
a well-sampled light curve not affected by colour changes effects; ii) two
snapshots/visit with different exposure times to avoid saturation during
flaring states; iii) a rolling cadence to get better-sampled light curves at
least in some time intervals. We also address the potential importance of
Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of blazar neutrino sources, and the
advantages of a Minisurvey with a star trail cadence (see white paper by David
Thomas et al.) for both the blazar science and the detection of possible very
fast optical counterparts of FRBs.

Recent polarization measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide new
insights on these enigmatic sources. We show that the nearly 100% linear
polarization and small variation of the polarization position angles (PAs) of
multiple bursts from the same source suggest that the radiation is produced
near the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star. As the emitted
radiation travels through the magnetosphere, the electric vector of the X-mode
wave adiabatically rotates and stays perpendicular to the local magnetic field
direction. The PA freezes at a radius where the plasma density becomes too
small to be able to turn the electric vector. At the freeze-out radius, the
electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron
star projected in the plane of the sky, independent of the radiation mechanism
or the orientation of the magnetic field in the emission region. We discuss a
number of predictions of the model. The variation of PAs from repeating FRBs
should follow the rotational period of the underlying neutron star (but the
burst occurrence may not be periodic). Measuring this period will provide
crucial support for the neutron star nature of the progenitors of FRBs. For FRB
121102, the small range of PA variation means that the magnetic inclination
angle is less than about 20 degrees and that the observer's line of sight is
outside the magnetic inclination cone. Other repeating FRBs may have a
different range of PA variation from that of FRB 121102, depending on the
magnetic inclination and the observer's viewing angle.

Lunar occultation, which occurs when the Moon crosses sight-lines to distant
sources, has been studied extensively through apparent intensity pattern
resulting from Fresnel diffraction, and has been successfully used to measure
angular sizes of extragalactic sources. However, such observations to-date have
been mainly over narrow bandwidth, or averaged over the observing band, and the
associated intensity pattern in time has rarely been examined in detail as a
function of frequency over a wide band. Here, we revisit the phenomenon of
lunar occultation with a view to study the associated intensity pattern as a
function of both time and frequency. Through analytical and simulation
approach, we examine the variation of intensity across the dynamic spectra, and
look for chromatic signatures which could appear as discrete dispersed signal
tracks, when the diffraction pattern is adequately smoothed by a finite source
size. We particularly explore circumstances in which such diffraction pattern
might closely follow the interstellar dispersion law followed by pulsars and
transients, such as the Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), which remain a mystery even
after a decade of their discovery. In this paper, we describe details of this
investigation, relevant to radio frequencies at which FRBs have been detected,
and discuss our findings, along with their implications. We also show how a
band-averaged light curve suffers from temporal smearing, and consequent
reduction in contrast of intensity variation, with increasing bandwidth. We
suggest a way to recover the underlying diffraction signature, as well as the
sensitivity improvement commensurate with usage of large bandwidths.

We propose a new model of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) based on stellar mass
black hole-massive star binaries. We argue that the inhomogeneity of the
circumstellar materials or/and the time varying wind activities of the stellar
companion will cause the black hole to accrete at a transient super-Eddington
rate. The collision among the clumpy ejecta in the resulted jet could trigger
plasma instability. As a result, the plasma in the jet will emit coherent
curvature radiation. When the jet cone aims toward the observer, the apparent
luminosity can be $10^{41}-10^{42}$\,erg/s. The duration of the resulted flare
is $\sim$ millisecond. The high event rate of the observed non-repeating FRBs
can be explained. A similar scenario in the vicinity of a supermassive black
hole can be used to explain the interval distribution of the repeating source
FRB121102 qualitatively.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10748v1
FRB 121102 is the only known repeating fast radio burst source. Here we
analyze a wide-frequency-range (1-8 GHz) sample of high-signal-to-noise,
coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank
telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include
sub-bursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure
complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is
appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse
structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 +/- 0.07
pc/cc at MJD 57644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the
sub-bursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later
times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the ~ 0.5-1-ms
sub-bursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100-400 MHz, and a
characteristic drift rate of ~ 200 MHz/ms towards lower frequencies. At higher
radio frequencies, the sub-burst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on
average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission
mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium
local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the
literature suggests an increase of Delta(DM) ~ 1-3 pc/cc in 4 years, though
this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This
implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of
frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously
proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.

With upcoming (continuum) surveys of high-resolution radio telescopes,
detection rates of fast radio bursts (FRBs) might approach $10^5$ per sky per
day by future extremely large observatories, such as the possible extension of
the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) to a phase 2 array. Depending on the redshift
distribution of FRBs and using the repeating FRB121102 as a model, we calculate
a detection rate of multiply-imaged FRBs with their multiply-imaged hosts
caused by the distribution of galaxy-cluster scale gravitational lenses of the
order of $10^{-4}$ per square degree per year for a minimum total flux of the
host of 10 $\mu$Jy at 1.4 GHz for SKA phase 2. Our comparison of estimated
detection rates for quasars, supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and FRBs shows that
multiple images of FRBs could be more numerous than those of gamma ray bursts
and supernovae and as numerous as multiple images of quasars. Time delays
between the multiple images of an FRB break degeneracies in model-based and
model-independent lens reconstructions as other time-varying sources do, yet
without a microlensing bias as FRBs are more point-like and have shorter
duration times. We estimate the relative imprecision of FRB time-delay
measurements to be $10^{-10}$ for time delays on the order of 100 days for
galaxy-cluster scale lenses, yielding more precise (local) lens properties than
time delays from the other time-varying sources. Using the lens modelling
software Grale, we show the increase in accuracy and precision of the
reconstructed scaled surface mass density map of a simulated cluster-scale lens
when adding time delays for one set of multiple images to the set of
observational constraints.

The fast radio burst FRB 121102 has repeated multiple times, enabling the
identification of its host galaxy and of a spatially-coincident, compact,
steady (`quiescent') radio synchrotron source. It was proposed that FRB 121102
is powered by a young flaring magnetar, embedded within a decades-old supernova
remnant. Using a time-dependent one-zone model, we show that a single expanding
magnetized electron-ion nebula (powered by the same outbursts likely
responsible for the FRBs) can explain all the basic properties of the quiescent
source (size, flux, self-absorption constraints) and the large but decreasing
rotation measure (RM) of the bursts. The quiescent emission is powered by
relativistic thermal electrons heated at the termination shock of the magnetar
wind, while the RM originates from non-relativistic electrons injected earlier
in the nebula's evolution and cooled through expansion and radiative losses.
The model contains few free parameters, which are tightly constrained by
observations: the total energy injected into the nebula over its history, $\sim
10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg, agrees with the magnetic energy of a millisecond
magnetar; the baryon loading of the magnetar outflow (driven by intermittent
flares) is close to the neutron star escape speed; the predicted source age
$\sim 10-40$ years is consistent with other constraints on the nebula size. For
an energy input rate $\dot{E} \propto t^{-\alpha}$ following the onset of
magnetar activity, we predict secular decay of the RM and quiescent source
flux, which approximately follow ${\rm RM} \propto t^{-(6+\alpha)/2}$ and
$F_{\nu} \propto t^{-(\alpha^2+7\alpha-2)/4}$, respectively.

In this paper we develop a model for fast radio bursts (FRBs) based on
triggered superradiance (SR) and apply it to previously published data of FRB
110220 and FRB 121102. We show how a young pulsar located at ~100 pc or more
from an SR/FRB system could initiate the onset of a powerful burst of radiation
detectable over cosmological distances. Our models using the OH$^2\Pi_{3/2}$
$\left(J=3/2\right)$ 1612 MHz and $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ $\left(J=5/2\right)$ 6030 MHz
spectral lines match the light curves well and suggest the entanglement of more
than $10^{30}$ initially inverted molecules over lengths of approximately 300
au for a single SR sample. SR also accounts for the observed temporal narrowing
of FRB pulses with increasing frequency for FRB 121102, and predicts a scaling
of the FRB spectral bandwidth with the frequency of observation, which we found
to be consistent with the existing data.

Almost a third of the cosmic baryons are "missing" at low redshifts, as they
reside in the invisible warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, which measures the line-of-sight integral of
the plasma pressure, can potentially detect this WHIM, although its expected
signal is hidden below the noise. Extragalactic dispersion measures
(DMs)---obtained through observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs)---are
excellent tracers of the WHIM, as they measure the column density of plasma,
regardless of its temperature. Here we propose cross correlating DMs and tSZ
maps as a new way to find and characterize the missing baryons in the WHIM. Our
method relies on the precise ($\sim$ arcminute) angular localization of FRBs to
assign each burst a DM and a $y$ parameter. We forecast that the signal from
the WHIM should be confidently detected in a cross-correlation analysis of
$\sim10^4$ FRBs, expected to be gathered in a year of operation of the upcoming
CHIME and HIRAX radio arrays, confirming the recent tentative detections of
filamentary WHIM. Using this technique, future CMB probes (which might lower
the tSZ noise) could determine both the temperature of the WHIM and its
evolution to within tens of percent. Altogether, DM-tSZ cross correlations hold
great promise for studying the baryons in the local Universe.

The field of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) science is currently thriving and growing
rapidly. The lines of active investigation include theoretical and
observational aspects of these enigmatic millisecond radio signals. These
pursuits are for the most part intertwined so that each keeps the other in
check, characteristic of the healthy state of the field. The immediate future
for FRB science is full of promise --- we will in the next few years see two
orders of magnitude more FRBs discovered by the now diverse group of
instruments spread across the globe involved in these efforts. This increased
crop, and the increased information obtained per event, will allow a number of
fundamental questions to be answered, and FRBs' potential as astrophysical and
cosmological tools to be exploited. Questions as to the exact detailed nature
of FRB progenitors and whether or not there are one or more types of progenitor
will be answered. Questions as to source counts, the luminosity distribution
and cosmological density of FRBs will also be addressed. Looking further ahead,
applications involving FRBs at the highest redshifts look set to be a major
focus of the field. The potential exists to evolve to a point where
statistically robust cosmological tests, orthogonal to those already undertaken
in other ways, will be achieved. Related work into FRB foregrounds, as well as
how to identify new events in ever more challenging radio-frequency
interference environments, also appear likely avenues for extensive
investigations in the coming years.

We review the potential information that can be gleaned from multi-wavelength
and multi-messenger detections of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The primary
function of such detections, following FRB localization, will be to reveal the
progenitors of FRB events. However, these observations serve a more basic
function in host galaxy identification, subsequent redshift measurement, and in
disentangling the contributions of various line-of-sight contributions to
properties of FRBs measured at radio wavelengths.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00109v1
The possibility of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) emission being suppressed at low
frequencies, resulting in a cutoff of the average rest-frame spectrum, has been
raised as an explanation for the lack of detections at meter wavelengths. We
examine propagation effects that could cause this suppression, and find that a
low-frequency spectral cutoff may be generic regardless of the specific FRB
emission mechanism. We then illustrate the effects of a low-frequency spectral
cutoff on the statistics of FRBs, given a cosmological source population. The
observed FRB rate peaks at a specific frequency under a variety of assumptions.
Observations at lower frequencies are more sensitive to high-redshift events
than observations above the maximal-rate frequency, and therefore result in
more sharply broken fluence distributions. Our results suggest that the absence
of low-frequency FRBs, and the differences between the Parkes and the
Australian Square Kilometre Array (ASKAP) FRB samples, can be fully explained
by suppressed low-frequency FRB emission.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) with unknown origin emit a huge luminosity (about 1
Jy at 1 GHz) with a duration of milliseconds or less at extragalactic distances
estimated from their large dispersion measure (DM). We propose herein a
scenario for a collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD) as
the progenitor of the FRBs by considering the burst duration scaling to the
collision time and the radio luminosity proportional to the kinetic energy of
the collision. The relations among the observed flux density, pulse width, and
the DM are derived from the model and compared with the statistical results
from the observed FRBs. Although the sample is quite small, we tentatively
report a nearly inverse-square correlation between the observed peak flux
density and the DM excess, which is an consequence of the assumption that the
DM excess (i.e. that not due to our Galaxy) is dominated by the intergalactic
medium. We also tentatively note a correlation among the duration of the FRB
and the DM excess (possibly interpreted as due to the broadening of the signal
in the intergalactic medium) and a correlation among the duration of the FRB
and the flux density (shorter burst should be brighter), both roughly in
agreement with the proposed model.

Plasma lensing events can have significant observational consequences,
including flux density modulations and perturbations in pulse arrival times. In
this paper we develop and apply a formalism that extends geometrical optics to
describe the effects of two dimensional plasma lenses of arbitrary shape. We
apply insights from catastrophe theory and the study of uniform asymptotic
expansions of integrals to describe the lensing amplification close to fold
caustics and in shadow regions, and explore the effects of image appearance and
disappearance at caustics in the time of arrival (TOA) perturbations due to
lensing. The enhanced geometric optics approach successfully reproduces the
predictions from wave optics and can be efficiently used to simulate
multifrequency TOA residuals during lensing events. Lensing will introduce
perturbations both in the way the residuals change as a function of frequency
and also in the magnitude and sign of the residuals averaged over a frequency
band. The deviations from the expected dispersive $\nu^{-2}$ scaling will be
most significant when including observations at low frequencies. We examine the
consequences of lensing in the context of precision pulsar timing and touch on
its potential relevance to the study of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11501v1
Under the assumption that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are from coherent
curvature emission powered by the dissipation of magnetic energy in the
magnetosphere of neutron stars, we predict a maximum isotropic equivalent
luminosity of (~2x10^{47} erg/s) min({\rho}^2, B{\rho}^{4/3}{\nu}^{-2/3}),
where {\rho} is the curvature radius of the magnetic field lines near the
source region in units of 10 km, B is the local magnetic field strength in
units of 10^{16} G, and {\nu} is the FRB wave frequency in units of GHz. This
is because the electric field responsible for accelerating the radiating
particles becomes close to the quantum critical field strength and is then
quickly shielded by Schwinger pairs within a nano-second. Future observations
should be able to confirm this cut-off luminosity and hence provide a unique
probe of the source location and magnetic field strength. We discuss how the
maximum luminosity affects the observed flux distributions for repeating bursts
from the same object and for the entire FRB population.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond pulses of radio emission of
seemingly extragalactic origin. More than 50 FRBs have now been detected, with
only one seen to repeat. Here we present a new FRB discovery, FRB 110214, which
was detected in the high latitude portion of the High Time Resolution Universe
South survey at the Parkes telescope. FRB 110214 has one of the lowest
dispersion measures of any known FRB (DM = 168.9$\pm$0.5 pc cm$^{-3}$), and was
detected in two beams of the Parkes multi-beam receiver. A triangulation of the
burst origin on the sky identified three possible regions in the beam pattern
where it may have originated, all in sidelobes of the primary detection beam.
Depending on the true location of the burst the intrinsic fluence is estimated
to fall in the range of 50 -- 2000 Jy ms, making FRB 110214 one of the
highest-fluence FRBs detected with the Parkes telescope. No repeating pulses
were seen in almost 100 hours of follow-up observations with the Parkes
telescope down to a limiting fluence of 0.3 Jy ms for a 2-ms pulse. Similar
low-DM, ultra-bright FRBs may be detected in telescope sidelobes in the future,
making careful modeling of multi-beam instrument beam patterns of utmost
importance for upcoming FRB surveys.

Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a sub-class of pulsars characterized by
sporadic emission and thus can generally only be studied by analysis of their
single-pulses. Here we present a single-pulse analysis using 11 years of timing
data at 1400~MHz of three RRATs, PSRs~J1819$-$1458, J1317$-$5759, and
J1913$+$1330. We perform a spectral analysis on the single-pulses of these
RRATs for the first time, finding their mean spectral indices to be $-1.1 \pm
0.1$, $-0.6 \pm 0.1$, and $-1.2 \pm 0.2$ respectively, within the known range
of pulsar spectral indices. We find no evidence for narrowband features as seen
for FRB~121102. However, we find the spread of single-pulse spectral indices
for these RRATs (ranging from $-7$ to $+4$) to be larger than has been seen in
other pulsars, with the exception of the Crab pulsar. We also analyze the time
between detected pulses, or wait-time, and find that the pulses are not random
and cluster around wait-times of a few pulse periods as well as $\sim 25$ pulse
periods for PSRs~J1819$-$1458 and J1317$-$5759. Additionally we find that there
is no correlation between the wait-time and pulse flux density. Finally we find
that the distribution of the pulse energy for PSRs~J1317$-$5759 and
J1913$+$1330 are log-normal, while that of PSR~J1819$-$1458 is log-normal with
possible evidence of an additional power-law component.

We estimate the upper limit redshifts of known FRBs using the dispersion
measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation and derive the upper limit peak
luminosity $L_p$ and energy $E$ of FRBs within the observational band. The
average $z$ upper limits range from 0.17 to 3.10, the average $L_p$ upper
limits range from $1.24 \times 10^{42} \rm erg \ s^{-1}$ to $7.80 \times
10^{44} \rm erg \ s^{-1}$, and the average $E$ upper limits range from $6.91
\times 10^{39}$ erg to $1.94 \times 10^{42}$ erg. FRB 160102 with DM $=2596.1
\pm 0.3 \ {\rm pc \ cm^{-3}}$ likely has a redshift greater than 3. Assuming
that its intrinsic DM contribution from the host and FRB source is ${\rm
DM_{host}+DM_{scr}}\sim 100 \ {\rm pc \ cm^{-3}}$, such an FRB can be detected
up to $z \sim 3.6$ by Parkes and by FAST under ideal conditions up to $z \sim
10.4$. Assuming that there exist FRBs detectable at $z\sim 15$ by sensitive
telescopes such as FAST, the upper limit DM for FRB searches may be set to
$\sim 9000 \ {\rm pc \ cm^{-3}}$. For single-dish telescopes, those with a
larger aperture tend to detect more FRBs than those with a smaller aperture if
the FRB luminosity function index $\alpha_{\rm L}$ is steeper than 2, and vice
versa. In any case, large-aperture telescopes such as FAST are more capable of
detecting high-$z$ FRBs, even though most of FRBs detected by them are still
from relatively low redshifts.

Fast Radio bursts (FRBs), bright transients with millisecond durations at
$\sim$ GHz and typical redshifts probably $>0.8$, are likely to be
gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. Since the time delay between
images of strongly lensed FRB can be measured to extremely high precision
because of the large ratio $\sim10^9$ between the typical galaxy-lensing delay
time $\sim\mathcal{O}$(10 days) and the width of bursts $\sim\mathcal{O}$(ms),
we propose strongly lensed FRBs as precision probes of the universe. We show
that, within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be
constrained with a $\sim0.91\%$ uncertainty from 10 such systems probably
observed with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) in $<$ 30 years. More
importantly, the cosmic curvature can be model-independently constrained to a
precision of $\sim0.076$. This constraint can directly test the validity of the
cosmological principle and break the intractable degeneracy between the cosmic
curvature and dark energy.

Faraday tomography is thought to be a powerful tool to explore cosmic
magnetic field. Broadband radio polarimetric data is essential to ensure the
quality of Faraday tomography, but such data is not easy to obtain because of
radio frequency interferences (RFIs). In this paper, we investigate optimum
frequency coverage of Faraday tomography so as to explore Faraday rotation
measure (RM) due to the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in filaments of
galaxies. We adopt a simple model of the IGMF and estimate confidence intervals
of the model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. We find that
meaningful constraints for RM due to the IGMF are available with data at
multiple narrowbands which are scattered over the ultra-high frequency (UHF,
300 MHz - 3000 MHz). The optimum frequency depends on the Faraday thickness of
the Milky Way foreground. These results are obtained for a wide brightness
range of the background source including fast radio bursts (FRBs). We discuss
the relation between the polarized-intensity spectrum and the optimum
frequency.

The slope of the source-count distribution of fast radio burst (FRB)
fluences, $\alpha$, has been estimated using a variety of methods. Hampering
all attempts have been the low number of detected FRBs, and the difficulty of
defining a completeness threshold for FRB surveys. In this work, we extend
maximum-likelihood methods for estimating $\alpha$, using detected and
threshold signal-to-noise ratios applied to all FRBs in a sample without regard
to a completeness threshold. Using this method with FRBs detected by the Parkes
radio telescope, we find $\alpha=-1.18 \pm 0.24$ (68\% confidence interval,
C.I.), i.e.\ consistent with a non-evolving Euclidean distribution
($\alpha=-1.5$). Applying these methods to the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) FRB
survey finds $\alpha=-2.2 \pm 0.47$ (68\% C.I.). A full maximum-likelihood
estimate finds an inconsistency with the Parkes rate with a p-value of 0.86\%
($2.6\, \sigma$). If not due to statistical fluctuations or biases in Parkes
data, this is the first evidence for deviations from a pure power law in the
integral source-count distribution of FRBs. It is consistent with a steepening
of the integral source-count distribution in the fluence range 5--40\,Jy\,ms,
for instance due to a cosmological population of FRB progenitors evolving more
rapidly than the star-formation rate, and peaking in the redshift range 1--3.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04355v1
We present the results of a coordinated campaign conducted with the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) to shadow Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) detected by the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 1.4 GHz, which resulted
in simultaneous MWA observations of seven ASKAP FRBs. We de-dispersed the $24$
$\times$ $1.28$ MHz MWA images across the $170-200$ MHz band taken at 0.5
second time resolution at the known dispersion measures (DMs) and arrival times
of the bursts and searched both within the ASKAP error regions (typically
$\sim$ $10$ arcmin $\times$ $10$ arcmin), and beyond ($4$ deg $\times$ $4$
deg). We identified no candidates exceeding a $5\sigma$ threshold at these DMs
in the dynamic spectra. These limits are inconsistent with the mean fluence
scaling of $\alpha=-1.8 \pm 0.3$ (${\cal F}_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$, where
$\nu$ is the observing frequency) that is reported for ASKAP events, most
notably for the three high fluence (${\cal F}_{1.4\,{\rm GHz}} \gtrsim 100$ Jy
ms) FRBs 171020, 180110 and 180324. Our limits show that pulse broadening alone
cannot explain our non-detections, and that there must be a spectral turnover
at frequencies above 200 MHz. We discuss and constrain parameters of three
remaining plausible spectral break mechanisms: free-free absorption, intrinsic
spectral turn-over of the radiative processes, and magnification of signals at
ASKAP frequencies by caustics or scintillation. If free-free absorption were
the cause of the spectral turnover, we constrain the thickness of the absorbing
medium in terms of the electron temperature, $T$, to $< 0.03$ $(T/10^4
K)^{-1.35}$ pc for FRB 171020.

We report on a search for the host galaxy of FRB171020, the fast radio burst
with the smallest recorded dispersion measure (DM $=114$ pc cm$^{-3}$) of our
on-ongoing ASKAP survey. The low DM confines the burst location within a
sufficiently small volume to rigorously constrain the identity of the host
galaxy. We identify 16 candidate galaxies in the search volume and single out
ESO 601-G036, a Sc galaxy at redshift $z=0.00867$, as the most likely host
galaxy. UV and optical imaging and spectroscopy reveal this galaxy has a
star-formation rate of approximately 0.1 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and oxygen
abundance $12 + \log({\rm O/H}) = 8.3 \pm 0.2$, properties remarkably
consistent with the galaxy hosting the repeating FRB121102. However, in
contrast to FRB121102, follow-up radio observations of ESO 601-G036 show no
compact radio emission above a 5$\sigma$ limit of $L_{2.1{\rm GHz}}=3.6\times
10^{19}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Using radio continuum observations of the field, combined
with archival optical imaging data, we find no analog to the persistent radio
source associated with FRB121102 within the localization region of FRB171020
out to $z=0.06$. These results suggest that FRBs are not necessarily associated
with a luminous and compact radio continuum source.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04353v1
We examine the spectra of 23 fast radio bursts detected in a fly's-eye survey
with the Australian SKA Pathfinder, including those of three bursts not
previously reported. The mean spectral index of $\alpha = -1.6_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$
($F_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) is close to that of the Galactic pulsar
population. The sample is dominated by bursts exhibiting a large degree of
spectral modulation: 17 exhibit fine-scale spectral modulation with an rms
exceeding 50% of the mean, with decorrelation bandwidths (half-maximum) ranging
from $\approx$ to 49 MHz. Most decorrelation bandwidths are an order of
magnitude lower than the $\gtrsim 30\,$MHz expected of Galactic interstellar
scintillation at the Galactic latitude of the survey, $|b| = 50 \pm 5 \deg$. A
test of the amplitude distribution of the spectral fluctuations reveals only 12
bursts consistent at better than a 5% confidence level with the prediction of
100%-modulated diffractive scintillation. Moreover, five of six FRBs with a
signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 18 are consistent with this prediction at less
than 1% confidence. Nonetheless, there is weak evidence (88-95% confidence)
that the amplitude of the fine-scale spectral modulation is anti-correlated
with dispersion measure (DM) that would suggest it originates as a propagation
effect. This effect appears to be corroborated by the smoothness of the
higher-DM Parkes FRBs, and could arise due to quenching of diffractive
scintillation (e.g. in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy) by angular
broadening in the intergalactic medium.

We present solutions of force-free pulsar magnetospheres coupled with a
uniform external magnetic field aligned with the dipole magnetic moment of the
pulsar. The inclusion of the uniform magnetic field has the following
consequences: The equatorial current sheet is truncated to a finite length, the
fraction of field lines that are open increases, and the open field lines are
confined within a cylindrical surface instead of becoming radial. A strong
external magnetic field antiparallel to the dipole allows for solutions where
the pulsar magnetic field is fully enclosed within an ellipsoidal surface.
Configurations of fully enclosed or confined magnetospheres may appear in a
double neutron star (DNS) where one of the components is a slowly rotating,
strongly magnetised pulsar and the other a weakly magnetised millisecond
pulsar. Depending on the geometry, twisted field lines from the millisecond
pulsar could form an asymmetric wind. More dramatic consequences could appear
closer to merger: there, the neutron star with the weaker magnetic field may
undergo a stage where it alternates between an open and a fully enclosed
magnetosphere releasing up $10^{38}$erg. Under favourable combinations of
magnetic fields DNSs can spend up to 10$^3$ yr in the coupled phase, implying a
Galactic population of $0.02$ systems. Potential observational signatures of
this interaction are discussed including the possibility of powering recurring
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We also note that the magnetic interaction cannot
have any significant effect on the spin evolution of the two pulsars.

The extremely high brightness temperatures of pulsars and fast radio bursts
(FRBs) require their radiation mechanisms to be coherent. Coherent curvature
radiation by bunches has been long discussed as the mechanism for radio pulsars
and recently for FRBs. Assuming that bunches are already generated in pulsar
magnetospheres, we calculate the spectrum of coherent curvature radiation under
a three-dimensional magnetic field geometry. Different from previous works
assuming parallel trajectories and a mono-energetic energy distribution of
electrons, we consider a bunch characterized by its length, curvature radius of
the trajectory family, bunch opening angle, and electron energy distribution.
We find that the curvature radiation spectra of the bunches are characterized
by a multi-segment broken power law, with the break frequencies depending on
bunch properties and trajectory configuration. We also emphasize that in a
pulsar magnetosphere only the fluctuation of net charges with respect to the
background (Goldreich-Julian) outflow can make a contribution to coherent
radiation. We apply this model to constrain the observed spectra of pulsars and
FRBs. For a typical pulsar ($B_p=10^{12}~{\rm G}$, $P=0.1~{\rm s}$), a small
fluctuation of the net charge $\delta n_{\rm GJ}\sim 0.1 n_{\rm GJ}$ can
provide the observable flux. For FRBs, the fluctuating net charge may be larger
due to its abrupt nature. For $\delta n_{\rm GJ}\sim n_{\rm GJ}$, a neutron
star with a strong magnetic field and fast rotation is required to power an FRB
in the spindown-powered model. The requirement is less stringent in the cosmic
comb model thanks to the larger cross section and compressed charge density of
the bunch made by the external astrophysical stream that combs the
magnetosphere.

The discovery of a repeating fast radio burst has led to the first precise
localization, an association with a dwarf galaxy, and the identification of a
coincident persistent radio source. However, further localizations are required
to determine the nature of FRBs, the sources powering them, and the possibility
of multiple populations. Here we investigate the use of associated persistent
radio sources to establish FRB counterparts, taking into account the
localization area and the persistent source flux density. Due to the lower
areal number density of radio sources compared to faint optical sources, robust
associations can be achieved for less precise localizations as compared to
direct optical host galaxy associations. For generally larger localizations
which preclude robust associations, the number of candidate hosts can be
reduced based on the ratio of radio-to-optical brightness. We find that
confident associations with $\sim 0.01-$1 mJy sources, comparable to the
luminosity of the persistent source associated with FRB 121102 over the
redshift range $z \approx 0.1 - 1$, require FRB localizations of $\lesssim
20''$. In the absence of a robust association, constraints can be placed on the
luminosity of an associated radio source as a function of localization and DM.
For DM $\approx 1000 \rm \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, an upper limit comparable to the
luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent source can be placed if the
localization is $\lesssim 10''$. We apply our analysis to the case of the ASKAP
FRB 170107, using optical and radio observations of the localization region. We
identify two candidate hosts based on a ratio of radio-to-optical brightness of
$\gtrsim 100$. We find that if one of these is associated with FRB 170107, the
resulting radio luminosity ($1 \times 10^{29} - 4 \times 10^{30} \ \rm erg \
s^{-1} \ Hz^{-1}$) is comparable to the luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent
source.

In the past decade, a new class of bright transient radio sources with
millisecond duration has been discovered. The origin of these so-called Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs) is still a great mystery despite the growing observational
efforts made by various multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities. So
far, many models have been proposed to explain FRBs but neither the progenitors
nor the radiative and the particle acceleration processes at work have been
clearly identified. In this paper, the question whether some hadronic processes
may occur in the vicinity of the FRB source is assessed. If so, FRBs may
contribute to the high energy cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes. A search for
these hadronic signatures has been done using the ANTARES neutrino telescope.
The analysis consists in looking for high-energy neutrinos, in the TeV-PeV
regime, spatially and temporally coincident with the detected FRBs. Most of the
FRBs discovered in the period 2013-2017 were in the field of view of the
ANTARES detector, which is sensitive mostly to events originating from the
Southern hemisphere. From this period, 12 FRBs have been selected and no
coincident neutrino candidate was observed. Upper limits on the per burst
neutrino fluence have been derived using a power law spectrum,
$\rm{\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\propto E_\nu^{-\gamma}}$, for the incoming neutrino
flux, assuming spectral indexes $\gamma$ = 1.0, 2.0, 2.5. Finally, the neutrino
energy has been constrained by computing the total energy radiated in neutrinos
assuming different distances for the FRBs. Constraints on the neutrino fluence
and on the energy released are derived from the associated null results.

We report the detection of 72 new pulses from the repeating fast radio burst
FRB 121102 in Breakthrough Listen C-band (4-8 GHz) observations at the Green
Bank Telescope. The new pulses were found with a convolutional neural network
in data taken on August 26, 2017, where 21 bursts have been previously
detected. Our technique combines neural network detection with dedispersion
verification. For the current application we demonstrate its advantage over a
traditional brute-force dedis- persion algorithm in terms of higher
sensitivity, lower false positive rates, and faster computational speed.
Together with the 21 previously reported pulses, this observa- tion marks the
highest number of FRB 121102 pulses from a single observation, total- ing 93
pulses in five hours, including 45 pulses within the first 30 minutes. The
number of data points reveal trends in pulse fluence, pulse detection rate, and
pulse frequency structure. We introduce a new periodicity search technique,
based on the Rayleigh test, to analyze the time of arrivals, with which we
exclude with 99% confidence pe- riodicity in time of arrivals with periods
larger than 5.1 times the model-dependent time-stamp uncertainty. In
particular, we rule out constant periods >10 ms in the barycentric arrival
times, though intrinsic periodicity in the time of emission remains plausible.

It is noted that the duration of a fast radio burst (FRB), about $10^{-3}$ s,
is a smaller fraction of the time delay between multiple images of a source
gravitationally lensed by a galaxy or galaxy cluster than the human lifetime is
to the age of the universe. Thus repeating, strongly lensed FRBs may offer an
unprecedented opportunity for observing cosmological evolution in "real time".
The possibility is discussed of observing cosmic expansion, transverse proper
motion, mass accretion and perhaps growth of density perturbations, as a
function of redshift.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05705v2
It has been suggested that a non-repeating fast radio burst (FRB) represents
the final signal of a magnetized neutron star collapsing to a black hole. In
this model, a supramassive neutron star supported by rapid rotation, will
collapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth as a
result of spin down. The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines
anchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that
will propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio
burst, i.e. a "blitzar". We present a systematic study of the gravitational
collapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to
far-field evolution at late times after the collapse. By considering a series
of neutron stars with rotation ranging from zero to millisecond periods and
different magnetic-field strengths, we show that the blitzar emission is very
robust and always characterised by a series sub-millisecond pulses decaying
exponentially in amplitude. The luminosity and energy released when the
magnetosphere is destroyed are well reproduced by a simple expression in terms
of the stellar magnetic field and radius. Finally, we assess the occurrence of
pair production during a blitzar scenario, concluding that for typical
magnetic-field strengths of $10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ and spin frequencies of a few
Hz, pair production is suppressed. Overall, the very good match between the
results of the simulations and the luminosities normally observed for FRBs
lends credibility to the blitzar model as a simple and yet plausible
explanation for the phenomenology of non-repeating FRBs.

Curvature radiation is a natural candidate for the emission mechanism of FRB.
However, FRB spectra have structure with $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim
\text{0.03--0.2}$, inconsistent with the very smooth spectrum of curvature
radiation. Although this spectral structure might be attributed to chromatic
scintillation or lensing, in four FRB high spectral resolution data indicate
scintillation decorrelation bandwidths much narrower than the observed $\sim
\text{30--300}$ MHz spectral structure. Some of the observed structure may be
intrinsic to the radiation mechanism. I suggest that the observed spectral
structure reflects the spatial structure of a clumpy radiating charge
distribution, and that the characteristic curvature radiation frequency may be
much higher than the observed frequencies. In this coupled plasma-curvature
radiation process the radiated spectra are the product of the spectra of the
plasma wave and that of incoherent curvature radiation. The argument applies to
all coherent radiation processes, including those that produce pulsar
nanoshots. The implied FRB "clump" charges are large, and produce electrostatic
potentials that suggest electron Lorentz factors $\gtrsim 10^2$. The result
applies generally to coherently radiating sources.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright flashes observed typically at GHz
frequencies with millisecond duration, whose origin is likely extragalactic.
Their nature remains mysterious, motivating searches for counterparts at other
wavelengths. FRB 121102 is so far the only source known to repeatedly emit FRBs
and is associated with a host galaxy at redshift $z \simeq 0.193$. We conducted
simultaneous observations of FRB 121102 with the Arecibo and MAGIC telescopes
during several epochs in 2016--2017. This allowed searches for
millisecond-timescale burst emission in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays as
well as the optical band. While a total of five FRBs were detected during these
observations, no VHE emission was detected, neither of a persistent nature nor
burst-like associated with the FRBs. The average integral flux upper limits
above 100 GeV at 95% confidence level are $6.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{photons\
cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ (corresponding to luminosity $L_{\rm VHE} \lesssim
10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) over the entire observation period, and $1.2
\times 10^{-7}~ \mathrm{photons\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ ($L_{\rm VHE} \lesssim
10^{49}~\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) over the total duration of the five FRBs. We
constrain the optical U-band flux to be below 8.6 mJy at 5-$\sigma$ level for
1-ms intervals around the FRB arrival times. A bright burst with U-band flux
$29~\mathrm{mJy}$ and duration $\sim 12$ ms was detected 4.3 s before the
arrival of one FRB. However, the probability of spuriously detecting such a
signal within the sampled time space is 1.5% (2.2 $\sigma$, post-trial), i.e.
consistent with the expected background. We discuss the implications of the
obtained upper limits for constraining FRB models.

Thirty-three fast radio bursts (FRBs) had been detected by March 2018.
Although the sample size is still limited, meaningful statistical studies can
already be carried out. The normalised luminosity function places important
constraints on the intrinsic power output, sheds light on the origin(s) of
FRBs, and can guide future observations. In this paper, we measure the
normalised luminosity function of FRBs. Using Bayesian statistics, we can
naturally account for a variety of factors such as receiver noise temperature,
bandwidth, and source selection criteria. We can also include astronomical
systematics, such as host galaxy dispersion measure, FRB local dispersion
measure, galaxy evolution, geometric projection effects, and Galactic halo
contribution. Assuming a Schechter luminosity function, we show that the
isotropic luminosities of FRBs have a power-law distribution that covers
approximately three orders of magnitude, with a power-law index ranging from
$-1.8$ to $-1.2$ and a cut off $\sim 2\times 10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. By
using different galaxy models and well-established Bayesian marginalisation
techniques, we show that our conclusions are robust against unknowns, such as
the electron densities in the Milky Way halo and the FRB environment, host
galaxy morphology, and telescope beam response.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a class of short-duration transients at radio
wavelengths with inferred astrophysical origin. The prototypical FRB is a
broadband signal that occurs over the extent of the receiver frequency range,
is narrow in time, and is highly dispersed, following a $\nu^{-2}$ relation.
However, some FRBs appear band-limited, and show apparent scintillation,
complex frequency-dependent structure, or multi-component pulse shapes. While
there is sufficient evidence that FRBs are indeed astrophysical, their one-off
nature necessitates extra scrutiny when reporting a detection as bona fide and
not a false positive. Currently, there is no formal validation framework for
FRBs, rather a set of community practices. In this article, we discuss
potential sources of false positives, and suggest a framework in which FRB-like
events can be evaluated as real or otherwise. We present examples of
false-positive events in data from the Arecibo, LOFAR, and Nanshan telescopes,
which while FRB-like, are found to be due to instrumental variations, noise,
and radio-frequency interference. Differentiating these false-positive
detections from astrophysical events requires knowledge and tests beyond
thresholded single-pulse detection. We discuss post-detection analyses,
verification tests, and datasets which should be provided when reporting an FRB
detection.

The scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) by the intergalactic medium (IGM)
is explored using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We confirm that the
scattering by the clumpy IGM has significant line-of-sight variations. We
demonstrate that the scattering by the IGM in the voids and walls of the cosmic
web is weak, but it can be significantly enhanced by the gas in clusters and
filaments. The observed non-monotonic dependence of the FRB widths on the
dispersion measures (DM) cannot determine whether the IGM is an important
scattering matter or not. The IGM may dominate the scattering of some FRBs, and
the host galaxy dominates others. For the former case, the scattering should be
primarily caused by the medium in clusters. A mock sample of 500 sources shows
that $\tau_{\rm{IGM}} \propto \rm{DM_{IGM}}^{1.6-2.1}$ at $z<1.5$. Assuming
that the turbulence follows Kolmogorov scaling, we find that an outer scale of
$L_0\sim 5\,$pc is required to make $\tau_{\rm{IGM}} \sim 1-10\,$ms at $\nu=1\,
$ GHz. The required $L_0\sim 5\, $pc can alleviate the tension in the
timescales of turbulent heating and cooling but is still $\sim 4$ orders of
magnitude lower than the presumed injection scale of turbulence in the IGM. The
gap is expected to be effectively shortened if the simulation resolution is
further increased. The mechanisms that may further reduce the gap are shortly
discussed. If future observations can justify the role of the IGM in the
broadening of FRBs, it can help to probe the gas in clusters and filaments.

Searches for millisecond-duration, dispersed single pulses have become a
standard tool used during radio pulsar surveys in the last decade. They have
enabled the discovery of two new classes of sources: rotating radio transients
and fast radio bursts. However, we are now in a regime where the sensitivity to
single pulses in radio surveys is often limited more by the strong background
of radio frequency interference (RFI, which can greatly increase the
false-positive rate) than by the sensitivity of the telescope itself. To
mitigate this problem, we introduce the Single-pulse Searcher (SpS). This is a
new machine-learning classifier designed to identify astrophysical signals in a
strong RFI environment, and optimized to process the large data volumes
produced by the new generation of aperture array telescopes. It has been
specifically developed for the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), an
ongoing survey for pulsars and fast radio transients in the northern
hemisphere. During its development, SpS discovered 7 new pulsars and blindly
identified ~80 known sources. The modular design of the software offers the
possibility to easily adapt it to other studies with different instruments and
characteristics. Indeed, SpS has already been used in other projects, e.g. to
identify pulses from the fast radio burst source FRB 121102. The software
development is complete and SpS is now being used to re-process all LOTAAS data
collected to date.

The origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is still mysterious. All FRBs to date
show extremely high brightness temperatures, requiring a coherent emission
mechanism. Using constraints derived from the physics of one of these
mechanisms, the synchrotron maser, as well as observations, we show that
accretion induced explosions of neutron stars with surface magnetic fields of
$B_*\lesssim10^{11}$ G are favoured as FRB progenitors.

We present a newly implemented single-pulse pipeline for the PALFA survey to
efficiently identify single radio pulses from pulsars, Rotating Radio
Transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We have conducted a
sensitivity analysis of this new pipeline in which multiple single pulses with
a wide range of parameters were injected into PALFA data sets and run through
the pipeline. Based on the recovered pulses, we find that for pulse widths $\rm
< 5\ ms$ the sensitivity of the PALFA pipeline is at most a factor of $\rm \sim
2$ less sensitive to single pulses than our theoretical predictions. For pulse
widths $\rm > 10\ ms$, as the $\rm DM$ decreases, the degradation in
sensitivity gets worse and can increase up to a factor of $\rm \sim 4.5$. Using
this pipeline, we have thus far discovered 7 pulsars and 2 RRATs and identified
3 candidate RRATs and 1 candidate FRB. The confirmed pulsars and RRATs have DMs
ranging from 133 to 386 pc cm$^{-3}$ and flux densities ranging from 20 to 160
mJy. The pulsar periods range from 0.4 to 2.1 s. We report on candidate FRB
141113, which we argue is likely astrophysical and extragalactic, having $\rm
DM \simeq 400\ pc~cm^{-3}$, which represents an excess over the Galactic
maximum along this line of sight of $\rm \sim$ 100 - 200 pc cm$^{-3}$. We
consider implications for the FRB population and show via simulations that if
FRB 141113 is real and extragalactic, the slope $\alpha$ of the distribution of
integral source counts as a function of flux density ($N (>S) \propto
S^{-\alpha}$) is $1.4 \pm 0.5$ (95% confidence range). However this conclusion
is dependent on several assumptions that require verification.

We have searched for optical variability in the host galaxy of the radio
variable source which is possibly associated with fast radio burst (FRB)
150418. We compare images of the galaxy taken 1 day after the burst using
Subaru/Suprime-Cam with images taken $\sim$ 1 year after the burst using
Gemini-South/GMOS. No optical variability is found between the two epochs with
a limiting absolute magnitude $\gtrsim -19$ (AB). This limit applies to optical
variability of the putative active galactic nucleus in the galaxy on a
timescale of $\sim$ 1 year, and also to the luminosity of an optical
counterpart of FRB~150418 one day after the burst should it have occurred in
this galaxy.

The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), bright millisecond radio transients,
is still somewhat of a mystery. Several theoretical models expect that the FRB
accompanies an optical afterglow (e.g., Totani 2013; Kashiyama et al. 2013). In
order to investigate the origin of FRBs, we perform $gri$-band follow-up
observations of FRB~151230 (estimated $z \lesssim 0.8$) with Subaru/Hyper
Suprime-Cam at $8$, $11$, and $14$~days after discovery. The follow-up
observation reaches a $50\%$ completeness magnitude of $26.5$~mag for point
sources, which is the deepest optical follow-up of FRBs to date. We find $13$
counterpart candidates with variabilities during the observation. We
investigate their properties with multicolor and multi-wavelength observations
and archival catalogs. Two candidates are excluded by the non-detection of
FRB~151230 in the other radio feed horns that operated simultaneously to the
detection, as well as the inconsistency between the photometric redshift and
that derived from the dispersion measure of FRB~151230. Eight further
candidates are consistent with optical variability seen in AGNs. Two more
candidates are well fitted with transient templates (Type IIn supernovae), and
the final candidate is poorly fitted with all of our transient templates and is
located off-center of an extended source. It can only be reproduced with rapid
transients with a faint peak and rapid decline and the probability of chance
coincidence is $\sim3.6\%$. We also find that none of our candidates are
consistent with Type Ia supernovae, which rules out the association of Type Ia
supernovae to FRB~151230 at $z\leq0.6$ and limits the dispersion measure of the
host galaxy to $\lesssim300$~pc~cm$^{-3}$ in a Type Ia supernova scenario.

We investigate how the statistical properties of dispersion measure (DM) and
apparent flux density/fluence of (non-repeating) fast radio bursts (FRBs) are
determined by unknown cosmic rate density history [$\rhoFRB (z)$] and
luminosity function (LF) of the transient events. We predict the distributions
of DMs, flux densities, and fluences of FRBs taking account of the variation of
the receiver efficiency within its beam, using analytical models of $\rhoFRB
(z)$ and LF. Comparing the predictions with the observations, we show that the
cumulative distribution of apparent fluences suggests that FRBs originate at
cosmological distances and $\rhoFRB$ increases with redshift resembling cosmic
star formation history (CSFH). We also show that a LF model with a bright-end
cutoff at log$_{10}L_\nu$ [erg s$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$] $\sim$ 34 are favored to
reproduce the observed DM distribution if $\rhoFRB (z)\propto$ CSFH, although
the statistical significance of the constraints obtained with the current size
of the observed sample is not high. Finally, we find that the correlation
between DM and flux density of FRBs is potentially a powerful tool to
distinguish whether FRBs are at cosmological distances or in the local universe
more robustly with future observations.

We report the detection of a glitch event in the pulsar J1709$-$4429 (also
known as B1706$-$44) during regular monitoring observations with the Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST). The glitch was found during timing
operations, in which we regularly observe over 400 pulsars with up to daily
cadence, while commensally searching for Rotating Radio Transients, pulsars,
and FRBs. With a fractional size of $\Delta\nu/\nu \approx 52.4 \times10^{-9}$,
the glitch reported here is by far the smallest known for this pulsar,
attesting to the efficacy of glitch searches with high cadence using UTMOST.

FRB 121102, the only repeating fast radio burst (FRB) known to date, was
discovered at 1.4 GHz and shortly after the discovery of its repeating nature,
detected up to 2.4 GHz. Here we present three bursts detected with the 100-m
Effelsberg radio telescope at 4.85 GHz. All three bursts exhibited frequency
structure on broad and narrow frequency scales. Using an autocorrelation
function analysis, we measured a characteristic bandwidth of the small-scale
structure of 6.4$\pm$1.6 MHz, which is consistent with the diffractive
scintillation bandwidth for this line of sight through the Galactic
interstellar medium (ISM) predicted by the NE2001 model. These were the only
detections in a campaign totaling 22 hours in 10 observing epochs spanning five
months. The observed burst detection rate within this observation was
inconsistent with a Poisson process with a constant average occurrence rate;
three bursts arrived in the final 0.3 hr of a 2 hr observation on 2016 August
20. We therefore observed a change in the rate of detectable bursts during this
observation, and we argue that boosting by diffractive interstellar
scintillations may have played a role in the detectability. Understanding
whether changes in the detection rate of bursts from FRB 121102 observed at
other radio frequencies and epochs are also a product of propagation effects,
such as scintillation boosting by the Galactic ISM or plasma lensing in the
host galaxy, or an intrinsic property of the burst emission will require
further observations.

We present a detailed analysis of post-correlation beamforming (i.e.
beamforming which involves only phased sums of the correlation of the voltages
of different antennas in an array), and compare it with the traditionally used
incoherent and phased beamforming techniques. Using data from the GMRT we show
that post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the
signal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of
magnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events
like fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the
post-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency
interference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than
the incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of
post-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam
from the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The
computational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their
suitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed. Techniques discussed
here would be of interest for all upcoming surveys with interferometric arrays.
Finally, we describe a time-domain survey with the GMRT using the
post-correlation beamformation as a case study. We find that post-correlation
beamforming will improve the current GMRT time-domain survey sensitivity by ~ 2
times for pulsars with periods of few 100s of millisecond and by many-folds for
even slower pulsars, making it one of the most sensitive surveys for pulsars
and FRBs at low and mid radio frequencies.

We examine how the various observable statistical properties of the FRB
population relate back to their fundamental physical properties in a model
independent manner. We analyse the flux density and fluence distributions of
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a tool to investigate their luminosity distance
distribution and the evolution of their prevalence throughout cosmic history.
We examine in detail particular scenarios in which the burst population follows
some power of the cosmic star formation rate. FRBs present an important
additional measurable over source counts of existing cosmological populations,
namely the dispersion measure. Based on the known redshift of FRB121102 (the
repeater) we expect at least 50% of the dispersion measure to be attributable
to the inter-galactic medium and hence it can be used as a proxy for distance.
We develop the framework to interpret the dispersion measure distribution, and
investigate how the effect of Helium reionization in the intergalactic medium
is evident in this distribution. Examination of existing data suggests that the
FRB luminosity function is flatter than a critical slope, making FRBs easily
detectable to large distances; in this regime the reduction in flux density
with distance is outweighed by the increase in the number of bright bursts
within the search volume.

Recent studies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have led to many theories
associating them with young neutron stars. If this is the case, then the
presence of supernova ejecta and stellar winds provide a changing dispersion
measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can potentially be probes of the
environments of FRB progenitors. Here we summarize the scalings for the DM and
RM in the cases of a constant density ambient medium and of a progenitor
stellar wind. Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the
dynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in
previous simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction.
Furthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant
sweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is
not ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts. The combined DM
and RM measurements for the repeating FRB 121102 are consistent with supernova
ejecta with an age of $\sim10^2-10^3\,{\rm yrs}$ expanding into a high density
($\sim100\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium. This naturally explains its
relatively constant DM over many years as well. Other FRBs with much lower RMs
may indicate that they are especially young supernovae in wind environments or
that their DMs are largely from the intergalactic medium. We therefore caution
about inferring magnetic fields from simply by dividing an RM by DM, because
these quantities could originate from distinct regions along the path an FRB
propagates.

Young, rapidly spinning magnetars are invoked as central engines behind a
diverse set of transient astrophysical phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts
(GRB), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), fast radio bursts (FRB), and binary
neutron star (NS) mergers. However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the
magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission
from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus
detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations
of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of
expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar
engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and
radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of
the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization
breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and
that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on $\sim 100
\, {\rm yr}$ timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply
these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger
GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh. In terms of radio transparency
and dispersion measure constraints, the repeating FRB 121102 is consistent with
originating from a young, $\gtrsim 30-100 \, {\rm yr}$, magnetar similar to
those inferred to power SLSNe. We further show that its high rotation measure
can be produced within the same nebula that is proposed to power the quiescent
radio source observed co-located with FRB 121102. Our results strengthen
previous work suggesting that at least some FRBs may be produced by young
magnetars, and motivate further study of engine powered transients.

Relativistic thermal electrons moving in a large-scale magnetic field can
produce synchrotron radiation. Linear synchrotron polarization can also be
produced by the relativistic thermal electrons. In this paper, we utilize a
hybrid thermal-nonthermal electron energy distribution to calculate circular
synchrotron polarization. We further compute the radiative transfer of the
synchrotron polarization in the optical and radio bands when we consider the
contribution of the thermal electrons. We attempt to apply the polarization
results to some astrophysical objects, such as kilonova like AT
2017gfo/GW170817, the fast radio burst (FRB), the Gamma-ray burst (GRB)
afterglow, and the supernova remnant (SNR). The large optical depth of
radiative transfer effects the small polarization degrees of these populations
when the media surrounding the synchrotron sources take heavy absorption to the
polarized photons. We need a strong magnetic field in our model to reproduce
the linear and circular polarization properties that were observed in FRB
140514. This indicates that FRBs have a neutron star origin.

The phenomenon of fast radio bursts (FRBs) was discovered in 2007. These are
powerful (0.1-100 Jy) single radio pulses with durations of several
milliseconds, large dispersion measures, and record high brightness
temperatures suggesting coherent emission mechanism. As of time of writing, 32
FRBs were recorded. There is also one repeating source from which already
hundreds of bursts have been detected. The FRB rate is estimated to amount up
to several thousand per day over the sky, and their isotropic sky distribution
likely suggests a cosmological origin. Since the discovery, different
hypotheses on the possible FRB nature have been proposed, however up to now the
origin of these transient events remains obscure. The most prospective models
treat them as being related to a bursting emission from magnetars -- neutron
stars whose activity is due to their magnetic field dissipation, -- or as being
analogs of giant pulses observed from several radio pulsars . Future increase
in the statistics of the observed FRBs and an improvement upon the FRB
population characteristics will make possible to use them as a new tool to
probe the intergalactic medium and to test fundamental physical theories.

Multi-band observations of the fast radio burst (FRB) 131104 show that this
burst may be associated with a gamma-ray transient entitled Swift J0644.5-5111.
Follow-up observations for potential X-ray and radio counterparts of FRB
131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 got null results and provided the upper limits of the
emission flux at 5.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz, $U$-band, and X-ray band. By assuming this
association and using these upper limits, environmental properties (the
fraction of energyin a magnetic field $\varepsilon_{\rm B}$ and the number
density $n$) of the progenitor system of FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 were
constrained in the context of the standard afterglow model that neglects the
non-relativistic effect and jet effect by several groups. In this paper, we
adopt a unified afterglow model that takes into account the non-relativistic
effect and jet effect and use the upper limits of four bands (5.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz,
$U$-band, and X-ray) to obtain more stringent constraints on the parameter
space spanned by $\varepsilon_{\rm B}$ and $n$. We thus suggest that FRB
131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 might originate from a black hole-neutron star merger
event. Moreover, we calculate multi-band emissions from a kilonova powered by
the radioactivity of $r$-process elements synthesized in the ejected
neutron-rich material and find that the $U$-band emission from the putative
kilonova is significantly lower than the upper limit of the observations.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio pulses whose
origins are unknown. To date, only one (FRB 121102) out of several dozen has
been seen to repeat, though the extent to which it is exceptional remains
unclear. We discuss detecting repetition from FRBs, which will be very
important for understanding their physical origin, and which also allows for
host galaxy localisation. We show how the combination of instrument
sensitivity, beamshapes, and individual FRB luminosity functions affect the
detection of sources whose repetition is not necessarily described by a
homogeneous Poisson process. We demonstrate that the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) could detect many new repeating FRBs for
which host galaxies could be subsequently localised using other
interferometers, but it will not be an ideal instrument for monitoring FRB
121102. If the luminosity distributions of repeating FRBs are given by
power-laws with significantly more dim than bright bursts, CHIME's repetition
discoveries could preferentially come not from its own discoveries, but from
sources first detected with lower-sensitivity instruments like the Australian
Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in fly's eye mode. We then discuss
observing strategies for upcoming surveys, and advocate following up sources at
approximately regular intervalsand with telescopes of higher sensitivity, when
possible. Finally, we discuss doing pulsar-like periodicity searching on FRB
follow-up data, based on the idea that while most pulses are undetectable,
folding on an underlying rotation period could reveal the hidden signal.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12265v1
Recently, some theoretical models predicted that a small fraction of fast
radio bursts (FRBs) could be associated with gravitational waves (GWs). In this
work, we discuss the possibility of using GW/FRB association systems, if
commonly detected in the future, as a complementary cosmic probe. We propose
that upgraded standard sirens can be constructed from the joint measurements of
luminosity distances $D_{L}$ derived from GWs and dispersion measures ${\rm
DM_{IGM}}$ derived from FRBs (i.e., the combination $D_{L}\cdot{\rm
DM_{IGM}}$). Moreover, unlike the traditional standard-siren approach (i.e.,
the $D_{L}$ method) and the $\rm DM_{IGM}$ method that rely on the optimization
of the Hubble constant $H_0$, this $D_{L}\cdot{\rm DM_{IGM}}$ method has the
advantage of being independent of $H_0$. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we
prove that the $D_{L}\cdot{\rm DM_{IGM}}$ method is more effective to constrain
cosmological parameters than $D_{L}$ or ${\rm DM_{IGM}}$ separately, and
enables us to achieve accurate multimessenger cosmology from around 100 GW/FRB
systems. Additionally, even if GW/FRB associations are not exist, the
methodology developed here can still be applied to those GWs and FRBs that
occur at the same redshifts.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio pulses from the sky with
millisecond durations and Jansky-level flux densities. Their origins are still
largely uncertain. Here we suggest a new model for FRBs. We argue that the
collision of a white dwarf with a black hole can give birth to a transient
accretion disk, from which powerful episodic magnetic blobs will be launched.
The collision between two consecutive magnetic blobs can result in a
catastrophic magnetic reconnection, which releases a large amount of free
magnetic energy and forms a forward shock. The shock propagates through the
cold magnetized plasma within the blob in the collision region, radiating
through synchrotron maser mechanism, which is responsible for a non-repeating
FRB signal. Our calculations show that the theoretical energetics, radiation
frequency, duration timescale, and event rate can be well consistent with the
observational characteristic of FRBs.

Radio pulsars scintillate because their emission travels through the ionized
interstellar medium via multiple paths, which interfere with each other. It has
long been realized that the scattering screens responsible for the
scintillation could be used as `interstellar lenses' to localize pulsar
emission regions. Most scattering screens, however, only marginally resolve
emission components, limiting results to statistical inferences and detections
of small positional shifts. Since screens situated close to the source have
better resolution, it should be easier to resolve emission regions of pulsars
located in high density environments such as supernova remnants or binaries in
which the pulsar's companion has an ionized outflow. Here, we report events of
extreme plasma lensing in the `Black Widow' pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, near the
phase in its 9.2 hour orbit in which its emission is eclipsed by its
companion's outflow. During the lensing events, the flux is enhanced by factors
of up to 70--80 at specific frequencies. The strongest events clearly resolve
the emission regions: they affect the narrow main pulse and parts of the wider
interpulse differently. We show that the events arise naturally from density
fluctuations in the outer regions of the outflow, and infer a resolution of our
lenses comparable to the pulsar's radius, about 10\,km. Furthermore, the
distinct frequency structures imparted by the lensing are reminiscent of what
is observed for the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102, providing
observational support for the idea that this source is observed through, and
thus at times strongly magnified by, plasma lenses.

Mysterious Fast Radio Bursts (FRB), still eluding a rational explanation, are
astronomical radio flashes with durations of milliseconds. They are thought to
be of an extragalactic origin, with luminosities orders of magnitude larger
than any known short timescale radio transients. Numerous models have been
proposed in order to explain these powerful and brief outbursts but none of
them is commonly accepted, it is not clear which of these scenarios might
account for real FRB. The crucial question that remains unanswered is: what
makes FRB so exceptionally powerful and so exceptionally rare?! If the bursts
are related with something happening with a star-scale object and its immediate
neighborhood, why all detected FRB events take place in very distant galaxies
and not in our own galaxy!? In this paper we argue that the non-linear
phenomenon - self-trapping - which may provide efficient but rarely occurring
beaming of radio emission towards an observer, coupled with another, also rare
but powerful phenomenon providing the initial radio emission, may account for
the ultra-rare appearance of FRB.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04448v2
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio sources at cosmological
distances. No counterparts in other bands have been observed for {
non-repeating FRBs}. Here we suggest the collapse of strange star crusts as a
possible origin for FRBs. Strange stars, which are composed of almost equal
numbers of u, d, and s quarks, may be encapsulated by a thin crust of normal
hadronic matter. When a strange star accretes matter from its environment, the
crust becomes heavier and heavier. It may finally collapse, leading to the
release of a large amount of magnetic energy and plenty of electron/positron
pairs on a very short timescale. Electron/positron pairs in the polar cap
region of the strange star can be accelerated to relativistic velocities,
streaming along the magnetic field lines to form a thin shell. FRBs are
produced by coherent emission from these electrons when the shell is expanding.
Basic characteristics of observed FRBs can be explained in our model.

We report a new Fast Radio Burst (FRB) discovered in real-time as part of the
UTMOST project at the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Radio Telescope (MOST).
FRB170827 is the first detected with our low-latency ($< 24$ s),
machine-learning-based FRB detection system. The FRB discovery was accompanied
by the capture of voltage data at the native time and frequency resolution of
the observing system, enabling coherent dedispersion and detailed off-line
analysis, which have unveiled fine temporal and frequency structure. The
dispersion measure (DM) of 176.80 $\pm$ 0.04 pc cm$^{-3}$, is the lowest of the
FRB population. The Milky Way contribution along the line of sight is $\sim$ 40
pc cm$^{-3}$, leaving an excess DM of $\sim$ 145 pc cm$^{-3}$. The FRB has a
fluence $>$ 20 $\pm$ 7 Jy ms, and is narrow, with a width of $\sim$ 400 $\mu$s
at 10$\%$ of its maximum amplitude. However, the burst shows three temporal
components, the narrowest of which is $\sim$ 30 $\mu$s, and a scattering
timescale of $4.1 \pm 2.7$ $\mu$s. The FRB shows spectral modulations on
frequency scales of 1.5 MHz and 0.1 MHz. Both are prominent in the dynamic
spectrum, which shows a very bright region of emission between 841 and 843 MHz,
and weaker, patchy emission across the entire band. We show the fine spectral
structure could arise in the FRB host galaxy, or its immediate vicinity.

We report on the polarization properties of two fast radio bursts (FRBs):
151230 and 160102 discovered in the SUrvey for Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio
Bursts (SUPERB) at the Parkes radio telescope. FRB 151230 is observed to be 6
$\pm$ 11% circularly polarized and 35 $\pm$ 13 % linearly polarized with a
rotation measure (RM) consistent with zero. Conversely, FRB 160102 is observed
to have a circular polarization fraction of 30 $\pm$ 11 %, linear polarization
fraction of 84 $\pm$ 15 % for RM = -221(6) rad m$^{-2}$ and the highest
measured DM (2596.1 $\pm$ 0.3 pc cm$^{-3}$) for an FRB to date. We examine
possible progenitor models for FRB 160102 in extragalactic, non-cosmological
and cosmological scenarios. After accounting for the Galactic foreground
contribution, we estimate the intrinsic RM to be -256(9) rad m$^{-2}$ in the
low-redshift case and $\sim 2.4 \times 10^{2}$ rad m$^{-2}$ in the
high-redshift case. We assess the relative likeliness of these scenarios and
how each can be tested. We also place constraints on the scattering measure and
study the impact of scattering on the signal's polarization position angle.

Over 80% of the cosmic baryon density is likely to be distributed in the
diffuse, $\gtrsim10^{4}$ K circum- and inter-galactic medium (CGM and IGM
respectively). We demonstrate that the dispersion measures (DMs) of samples of
localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure the distribution of
baryons between the CGM and IGM. We propose to separate the CGM and IGM
contributions to FRB DMs by including redshift and mass measurements of
intervening galaxies. Using simulated samples of FRB sightlines through
intervening galaxy halos and an illustrative model for the CGM, and including
realistic observational uncertainties, we show that small samples
($O(10^{1})-O(10^{2})$) of localized FRBs are sensitive to the presence of CGM
gas. The fractions of baryons in the CGM and IGM can be accurately estimated
with 100 FRBs at $z<1$, and the characteristic radial density profiles of CGM
halos may also be possible to constrain. The required samples of localized FRBs
are expected to be assembled in the coming few years by instruments such as the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Very Large Array, and the
Deep Synoptic Array.

The discovery of the `Lorimer Burst', a little over a decade ago, ignited
renewed interest in searching for short-duration radio transients. This event
is now considered to be the first established Fast Radio Burst (FRB), which is
a class of millisecond-duration radio transients. The large dispersive delays
observed in FRBs distinguish them from the individual bright pulses from
Galactic pulsars, and suggests that they originate deep in extragalactic space.
Amazingly, FRBs are not rare: the implied event rate ranges up to many
thousands of events per sky, per day. The fact that only two dozen FRBs have
been discovered to date is a consequence of the limited sensitivity and field
of view of current radio telescopes. The precise localization of FRB 121102,
the first and currently only FRB observed to repeat, has led to the unambiguous
identification of its host galaxy and thus proven its extragalactic origin and
large energy scale. It remains unclear, however, whether all FRBs are capable
of repeating (many appear far less active) or whether FRB 121102 implies that
there are multiple sub-classes. Regardless, the repetitive nature of FRB 121102
and its localization to within a star-forming region in the host galaxy imply
that the bursts might originate from an exceptionally powerful neutron star -
one necessarily quite unlike any we have observed in the Milky Way. In these
proceedings, I give a very brief introduction to the FRB phenomenon and focus
primarily on the insights that FRB 121102 has provided thus far.

We report the first detections of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB
121102 above 5.2 GHz. Observations were performed using the 4$-$8 GHz receiver
of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with the Breakthrough Listen digital
backend. We present the spectral, temporal and polarization properties of 21
bursts detected within the first 60 minutes of a total 6-hour observations.
These observations comprise the highest burst density yet reported in the
literature, with 18 bursts being detected in the first 30 minutes. A few bursts
clearly show temporal sub-structures with distinct spectral properties. These
sub-structures superimpose to provide enhanced peak signal-to-noise ratio at
higher trial dispersion measures. Broad features occur in $\sim 1$ GHz wide
subbands that typically differ in peak frequency between bursts within the
band. Finer-scale structures ($\sim 10-50$ MHz) within these bursts are
consistent with that expected from Galactic diffractive interstellar
scintillation. The bursts exhibit nearly 100% linear polarization, and a large
average rotation measure of 9.359$\pm$0.012 $\times$ 10$^{\rm 4}$ rad m$^{\rm
-2}$ (in the observer's frame). No circular polarization was found for any
burst. We measure an approximately constant polarization position angle in the
13 brightest bursts. The peak flux densities of the reported bursts have
average values (0.2$\pm$0.1 Jy), similar to those seen at lower frequencies
($<3$ GHz), while the average burst widths (0.64$\pm$0.46 ms) are relatively
narrower.

We present SMA and NOEMA observations of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 in the
CO 3-2 and 1-0 transitions, respectively. We do not detect emission from either
transition. We set $3\sigma$ upper limits to the CO luminosity $L_{CO} < 2.5
\times 10^7\,{\rm K\,km\,s}^{-1} {\, \rm pc^{-2}}$ for CO 3-2 and $L_{CO} < 2.3
\times 10^9\, {\rm K\,km\,s}^{-1} {\, \rm pc^{-2}}$ for CO 1-0. For
Milky-Way-like star formation properties, we set a $3\sigma$ upper limit on the
$H_2$ mass of $2.5 \times 10^8 \rm\ M_{\odot}$, slightly less than the
predictions for the $H_2$ mass based on the star formation rate. The true
constraint on the $H_2$ mass may be significantly higher, however, because of
the reduction in CO luminosity that is common forlow-metallicity dwarf galaxies
like the FRB host galaxy. These results demonstrate the challenge of
identifying the nature of FRB progenitors through study of the host galaxy
molecular gas. We also place a limit of 42 $\mu$Jy ($3\sigma$) on the continuum
flux density of the persistent radio source at 97 GHz, consistent with a
power-law extrapolation of the low frequency spectrum, which may arise from an
AGN or other nonthermal source.

The population of fast radio bursts (FRBs) will continue to diverge into two
groups depending on their method of discovery: those which can be localised,
and those which cannot. Events potentially less useful for astronomical and
cosmological purposes due to limited localisation will accumulate with the
advent of new facilities and continued efforts by, e.g., the SUPERB
collaboration, which may require afterglows or multi-wavelength counterparts
for sub-arcsecond localisation. It is important to exploit these sources to
their maximum scientific potential. We perform analysis of FRB dispersion
measures (DMs), considering different theoretical FRB progenitors with view to
place more rigorous constraints on FRB redshifts, in particular for large
statistical samples, via their DMs. We review FRB DM components, and build
redshift-scalable probability distributions corresponding to different
progenitor scenarios. We combine these components into a framework for
obtaining FRB DM probabilities given their redshifts. Taking into account
different possibilities for the evolution of progenitors across cosmic time we
invert this model, thus deriving redshift constraints. Effects of varying FRB
progenitor models are illustrated. While, as expected, host galaxy DM
contributions become decreasingly important with increasing redshift, for
AGN-like progenitor scenarios they could remain significant out to redshift 3.
Constraints are placed on redshifts of catalogued FRBs with various models and
increasingly realistic models may be employed as general understanding of FRBs
improves. For localised FRBs, we highlight future prospects for disentangling
host and intergalactic medium DM components using their respective redshift
scaling. We identify a use for large samples of unlocalised FRBs resulting from
upcoming flux-limited surveys, such as with CHIME, in mapping out the Milky Way
contribution to the DM.

The majority of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are poorly localised, hindering
their potential scientific yield as galactic, intergalactic, and cosmological
probes. LOFT-e, a digital backend for the U.K.'s e-MERLIN seven-telescope
interferometer will provide commensal search and real-time detection of FRBs,
taking full advantage of its field of view (FoV), sensitivity, and observation
time. Upon burst detection, LOFT-e will store raw data offline, enabling the
sub-arcsecond localisation provided by e-MERLIN and expanding the pool of
localised FRBs. The high-time resolution backend will additionally introduce
pulsar observing capabilities to e-MERLIN.

We have proposed a model of non repeating fast radio bursts ( FRBs ); the
collisions between axion stars and neutron stars generate the bursts. In this
paper, we propose a model of repeating FRBs which shows that they arise from
the several collisions between magnetized accretion disk of a black hole and an
axion star orbiting the black hole. There would be many axions stars condensing
as dark matter in an early stage galaxy so that such collisions arises
repeatedly. The radiations are emitted by coherent oscillations of electrons in
the accretion disk. The oscillations are caused by oscillating electric fields,
which are induced by axion stars under strong magnetic field $\sim
O(10^{11})$G. The emissions are terminated by the thermal fluctuations of the
electrons which result from the thermalization of the oscillation energies.
Although the radiations are monochromatic, the thermal Doppler effects broaden
the spectral lines; their spectra $S(\nu)$ are given by $S(\nu) \propto
\exp(-(\nu-\nu_c)^2/2(\delta\nu)^2)$ with the center frequency $\nu_c$. The
bandwidth $\delta\nu=\nu_c\sqrt{T_c/m_e}$ with electron mass $m_e$ is
determined by the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the thermal fluctuations
terminate the coherent emissions. The observed bandwidths
$(3\sim5)\times10^2$MHz are originated from the strong magnetic fields $\sim
O(10^{11})$G. With such strong magnetic fields, large amount of the burst
energies are produced. Various center frequencies $\nu_c$ of the bursts in the
repeating FRB 121102 come from the various rotation speeds in the disk which
make an intrinsic frequency of the bursts being Doppler shifted. The recent
observation showing an extreme magneto-ionic environment around the source of
FRB 121102 supports our model.

The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a novel transit
radio telescope operating across the 400-800-MHz band. CHIME is comprised of
four 20-m x 100-m semi-cylindrical paraboloid reflectors, each of which has 256
dual-polarization feeds suspended along its axis, giving it a >200 square
degree field-of-view. This, combined with wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, and
a powerful correlator makes CHIME an excellent instrument for the detection of
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB) will
search beam-formed, high time-and frequency-resolution data in real time for
FRBs in the CHIME field-of-view. Here we describe the CHIME/FRB backend,
including the real-time FRB search and detection software pipeline as well as
the planned offline analyses. We estimate a CHIME/FRB detection rate of 2-42
FRBs/sky/day normalizing to the rate estimated at 1.4-GHz by Vander Wiel et al.
(2016). Likely science outcomes of CHIME/FRB are also discussed. CHIME/FRB is
currently operational in a commissioning phase, with science operations
expected to commence in the latter half of 2018.

Recent observations show that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are energetic but
probably non-catastrophic events occurring at cosmological distances. The
properties of their progenitors are largely unknown in spite of many attempts
to determine them using the event rate, duration and energetics. Understanding
the radiation mechanism for FRBs should provide the missing insights regarding
their progenitors, which is investigated in this paper. The high brightness
temperatures (>10^{35} K) of FRBs mean that the emission process must be
coherent. Two general classes of coherent radiation mechanisms are considered
--- maser and the antenna mechanism. We use the observed properties of the
repeater FRB 121102 to constrain the plasma conditions needed for these two
mechanisms. We have looked into a wide variety of maser mechanisms operating in
either vacuum or plasma and find that none of them can explain the high
luminosity of FRBs without invoking unrealistic or fine-tuned plasma
conditions. The most favorable mechanism is antenna curvature emission by
coherent charge bunches where the burst is powered by magnetic reconnection
near the surface of a magnetar (B > 10^{14} G). We show that the plasma in the
twisted magnetosphere of a magnetar may be clumpy due to two-stream
instability. When magnetic reconnection occurs, the pre-existing density clumps
may provide charge bunches for the antenna mechanism to operate. This model
should be applicable to all FRBs that have multiple outbursts like FRB 121102.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06266v1
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are usually suggested to be associated with mergers
of compact binaries consisting of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), or
black holes (BHs). We test these models by fitting the observational
distributions in both redshift and isotropic energy of 22 Parkes FRBs, where,
as usual, the rates of compact binary mergers (CBMs) are connected with cosmic
star formation rates by a power-law distributed time delay. It is found that
the observational distributions can well be produced by the CBM model with a
characteristic delay time from several ten to several hundred Myr and an energy
function index $1.2\lesssim\gamma\lesssim1.7$, where a tentative fixed spectral
index $\beta=0.8$ is adopted for all FRBs. Correspondingly, the local event
rate of FRBs is constrained to $(3-6)\times10^4f_{\rm b}^{-1}(\mathcal T/270\rm
s)^{-1}(\mathcal A/2\pi)^{-1}\rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for an adopted minimum FRB
energy of $E_{\min}=3\times10^{39}$ erg, where $f_{\rm b}$ is the beaming
factor of the radiation, $\mathcal T$ is the duration of each pointing
observation, and $\mathcal A $ is the sky area of the survey. This event rate,
about an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers,
indicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be
mergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was
found to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all
FRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current
observations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms
from relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD
binaries.

Upcoming Fast Radio Burst (FRB) surveys will search $\sim$10\,$^3$ beams on
sky with very high duty cycle, generating large numbers of single-pulse
candidates. The abundance of false positives presents an intractable problem if
candidates are to be inspected by eye, making it a good application for
artificial intelligence (AI). We apply deep learning to single pulse
classification and develop a hierarchical framework for ranking events by their
probability of being true astrophysical transients. We construct a tree-like
deep neural network (DNN) that takes multiple or individual data products as
input (e.g. dynamic spectra and multi-beam detection information) and trains on
them simultaneously. We have built training and test sets using false-positive
triggers from real telescopes, along with simulated FRBs, and single pulses
from pulsars. Training of the DNN was independently done for two radio
telescopes: the CHIME Pathfinder, and Apertif on Westerbork. High accuracy and
recall can be achieved with a labelled training set of a few thousand events.
Even with high triggering rates, classification can be done very quickly on
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). That speed is essential for selective
voltage dumps or issuing real-time VOEvents. Next, we investigate whether
dedispersion back-ends could be completely replaced by a real-time DNN
classifier. It is shown that a single forward propagation through a moderate
convolutional network could be faster than brute-force dedispersion; but the
low signal-to-noise per pixel makes such a classifier sub-optimal for this
problem. Real-time automated classification may prove useful for bright,
unexpected signals, both now and in the era of radio astronomy when data
volumes and the searchable parameter spaces further outgrow our ability to
manually inspect the data, such as for SKA and ngVLA.

We consider the possible observation of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with planned
future radio telescopes, and investigate how well the dispersions and redshifts
of these signals might constrain cosmological parameters. We construct mock
catalogues of FRB dispersion measure (DM) data and employ Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) analysis, with which we forecast and compare with existing
constraints in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as some popular extensions
that include dark energy equation of state and curvature parameters. We find
that the scatter in DM observations caused by inhomogeneities in the
intergalactic medium (IGM) poses a big challenge to the utility of FRBs as a
cosmic probe. Only in the most optimistic case, with a high number of events
and low IGM variance, do FRBs aid in improving current constraints. In
particular, when FRBs are combined with CMB+BAO+SNe+$H_0$ data, we find the
biggest improvement comes in the $\Omega_{\mathrm b}h^2$ constraint. Also, we
find that the dark energy equation of state is poorly constrained, while the
constraint on the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, shows some improvement when
combined with current constraints. When FRBs are combined with future BAO data
from 21cm Intensity Mapping (IM), we find little improvement over the
constraints from BAOs alone. However, the inclusion of FRBs introduces an
additional parameter constraint, $\Omega_{\mathrm b}h^2$, which turns out to be
comparable to existing constraints. This suggest that FRBs provide valuable
information about the cosmological baryon density in the intermediate redshift
Universe, independent of high redshift CMB data.

Most of fast radio bursts (FRB) do not show evidence for repetition, and such
non-repeating FRBs may be produced at the time of a merger of binary neutron
stars (BNS), provided that the BNS merger rate is close to the high end of the
currently possible range. However, the merger environment is polluted by
dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine
this by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that
the ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star
becomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal
can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be
explained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may
leave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the
origin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102. We show that a merger remnant would
appear as a repeating FRB in a time scale of about 1-10 yrs, and expected
properties are consistent with the observations of FRB 121102. We construct an
FRB rate evolution model including these two populations of repeating and
non-repeating FRBs from BNS mergers, and show that the detection rate of
repeating FRBs relative to non-repeating ones rapidly increases with improving
search sensitivity. This may explain that the only repeating FRB 121102 was
discovered by the most sensitive FRB search with Arecibo. Several predictions
are made, including appearance of a repeating FRB 1-10 years after a BNS merger
that is localized by gravitational wave and subsequent electromagnetic
radiation.

Here, we report non-detection of radio bursts from Fast Radio Burst FRB
121102 during two 5-hour observation sessions on the Robert C. Byrd 100-m Green
Bank Telescope in West Virginia, USA, on December 11, 2017, and January 12,
2018. In addition, we report non-detection during an abutting 10-hour
observation with the Kunming 40-m telescope in China, which commenced UTC 10:00
January 12, 2018. These are among the longest published contiguous observations
of FRB 121102, and support the notion that FRB 121102 bursts are episodic.
These observations were part of a simultaneous optical and radio monitoring
campaign with the the Caltech HIgh- speed Multi-color CamERA (CHIMERA)
instrument on the Hale 5.1-m telescope.

The search of fast radio burst (FRB) is a hot topic in current radio
astronomy study. In this work, we carry out single pulse search for a VLBI
pulsar observation data set using both auto spectrum and cross spectrum search
method. The cross spectrum method is first proposed in Liu et al. (2018), which
maximizes the signal power by fully utilizing the fringe phase information of
the baseline cross spectrum. The auto spectrum search method is based on the
popular pulsar software package PRESTO, which extracts single pulses from the
auto spectrum of each station. According to our comparison, the cross spectrum
method is able to enhance the signal power and therefore extract single pules
from highly RFI contaminated data, which makes it possible to carry out FRB
search in regular VLBI observations with the presence of RFIs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05436v2
The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains mysterious. Recently, the only
repeating FRB source, FRB 121102, was reported to possess an extremely large
and variable rotation measure (RM). The inferred magnetic field strength in the
burst environment is comparable to that in the vicinity of the super-massive
black hole Sagittarius A* of our Galaxy. Here we show that all the
observational properties of FRB 121102 (including the high RM and its
evolution, the high linear polarization degree, an invariant polarization angle
across each burst and other properties previously known) can be interpreted
within the cosmic comb model invoking a regular neutron star whose
magnetosphere is sporadically and marginally combed by a variable outflow from
a nearby low-luminosity accreting super-massive black hole in the host galaxy.
We propose three falsifiable predictions of the model and discuss other FRBs
within the context of the cosmic comb model as well as the challenges
encountered by other repeating FRB models in light of the new observations.

The repeating FRB 121102 (the "repeater") shows {repetitive bursting
activities} and was localized in a host galaxy at $z=0.193$. On the other hand,
despite dozens of hours of telescope time spent on follow-up observations, no
other FRBs have been observed to repeat. Yet, it has been speculated that the
repeater is the prototype of FRBs, and that other FRBs should show similar
repeating patterns. Using the published data, we compare the repeater with
other FRBs in the observed time interval ($\Delta t$) - flux ratio ($S_i /
S_{i+1}$) plane. We find that whereas other FRBs occupy the upper (large $S_i /
S_{i+1}$) and right (large $\Delta t$) regions of the plane due to the
non-detections of other bursts, some of the repeater bursts fall into the
lower-left region of the plot (short interval and small flux ratio) excluded by
the non-detection data of other FRBs. The trend also exists even if one only
selects those bursts detectable by the Parkes radio telescope. If other FRBs
were similar to the repeater, our simulations suggest that the probability that
none of them have been detected to repeat with the current searches would be
$\sim (10^{-4}-10^{-3})$. We suggest that the repeater is not representative of
the entire FRB population and that there is strong evidence of more than one
population of FRBs.

The possibility that a fraction of the dark matter is comprised of massive
compact halo objects (MACHOs) remains unclear, especially in the 20-100
$M_{\odot}$ window. MACHOs could make up binaries, whose mergers may be
detected by LIGO as gravitational wave events. On the other hand, the
cosmological origin of fast radio burst (FRBs) has been confirmed. We
investigate the possibility of detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) gravitational
lensed by MACHO binaries to constrain their properties. Since lensing events
could generate more than one images, lensing by binaries could cause
multiple-peak FRBs. The angular separation between these images is roughly
$10^{-3}$ mas, which is too small to be resolved. The typical time interval
between different images is roughly 1 millisecond (ms). The flux ratio between
different images is roughly from 10 to $10^3$. With the expected detection rate
of $10^4$ FRBs per year by the upcoming experiments, we could expect five
multi-peak FRBs observed per year with time interval larger than 1 ms and flux
ratio less than $10^3$ if the fraction of dark matter in MACHOs is $f\sim0.01$.
A null search multiple-peak FRBs for time interval larger than 1 ms and flux
ratio less than $10^3$ with $10^4$ FRBs would constrain the fraction $f$ of
dark matter in MACHOs to $f<0.001$.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, extragalactic radio
flashes of unknown physical origin. FRB 121102, the only known repeating FRB
source, has been localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy at
redshift z = 0.193, and is spatially coincident with a compact, persistent
radio source. The origin of the bursts, the nature of the persistent source,
and the properties of the local environment are still debated. Here we present
bursts that show ~100% linearly polarized emission at a very high and variable
Faraday rotation measure in the source frame: RM_src = +1.46 x 10^5 rad m^-2
and +1.33 x 10^5 rad m^-2 at epochs separated by 7 months, in addition to
narrow (< 30 mus) temporal structure. The large and variable rotation measure
demonstrates that FRB 121102 is in an extreme and dynamic magneto-ionic
environment, while the short burst durations argue for a neutron star origin.
Such large rotation measures have, until now, only been observed in the
vicinities of massive black holes (M_BH > 10^4 MSun). Indeed, the properties of
the persistent radio source are compatible with those of a low-luminosity,
accreting massive black hole. The bursts may thus come from a neutron star in
such an environment. However, the observed properties may also be explainable
in other models, such as a highly magnetized wind nebula or supernova remnant
surrounding a young neutron star.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02391v1
We introduce the cross spectrum based FRB (Fast Radio Burst) search method
for VLBI observation. This method optimizes the fringe fitting scheme in
geodetic VLBI data post processing, which fully utilizes the cross spectrum
fringe phase information and therefore maximizes the power of single pulse
signals. Working with cross spectrum greatly reduces the effect of radio
frequency interference (RFI) compared with using auto spectrum. Single pulse
detection confidence increases by cross identifying detections from multiple
baselines. By combining the power of multiple baselines, we may improve the
detection sensitivity. Our method is similar to that of coherent beam forming,
but without the computational expense to form a great number of beams to cover
the whole field of view of our telescopes. The data processing pipeline
designed for this method is easy to implement and parallelize, which can be
deployed in various kinds of VLBI observations. In particular, we point out
that VGOS observations are very suitable for FRB search.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00640v1
We briefly review main observational properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs)
and discuss two most popular hypothesis for the explanation of these enigmatic
intense millisecond radio flashes. FRBs most probably originate on
extragalactic distances, and their rate on the sky is about a few thousand per
day with fluences above $\sim$~1~Jy~ms (or with fluxes larger than few tenths
of Jy). Two leading scenarios describing these events include strong flares of
magnetars and supergiant pulses of young radio pulsars with large rotational
energy losses, correspondingly. At the moment, it is impossible to choose
between these models. However, new telescopes can help to solve the puzzle of
FRBs in near future.

We present a search for coincidence between IceCube TeV neutrinos and fast
radio bursts (FRBs). During the search period from 2010 May 31 to 2016 May 12,
a total of 29 FRBs with 13 unique locations have been detected in the whole
sky. An unbinned maximum likelihood method was used to search for spatial and
temporal coincidence between neutrinos and FRBs in expanding time windows, in
both the northern and southern hemispheres. No significant correlation was
found in six years of IceCube data. Therefore, we set upper limits on neutrino
fluence emitted by FRBs as a function of time window duration. We set the most
stringent limit obtained to date on neutrino fluence from FRBs with an $E^{-2}$
energy spectrum assumed, which is 0.0021 GeV cm$^{-2}$ per burst for emission
timescales up to \textasciitilde10$^2$ seconds from the northern hemisphere
stacking search.

Scenario of formation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is proposed. Just like
radio pulsars, sources of FRBs are magnetized neutron stars. Appearance of
strong electric field in a magnetosphere of a neutron star is associated with
close passage of a dense body near hot neutron star. For the repeating source
FRB 121102, which has been observed in four series of bursts, the period of
orbiting of the body is about 200 days. Thermal radiation from the surface of
the star (temperature is of the order of $ 10^8 \, K $) causes evaporation and
ionization of the matter of the dense body. Ionized gas (plasma) flows around
the magnetosphere of the neutron star with the velocity $ u \simeq 10^7 \, cm /
s $, and creates electric potential $ \psi_0 \simeq 10^{11} \, V $ in the polar
region of the magnetosphere. Electrons from the plasma flow are accelerated
toward the star, and gain Lorentz factor of $ \simeq 10 ^ 5 $. Thermal photons
moving toward precipitating electrons are scattered by them, and produce gamma
photons with energies of $ \simeq 10^5 \, m_e c^2 $. These gamma quanta produce
electron-positron pairs in collisions with thermal photons. The multiplicity,
the number of born pairs per one primary electron, is about $ 10^5 $. The
electron-positron plasma, produced in the polar region of magnetosphere,
accumulates in a narrow layer at a bottom of a potential well formed on one
side by a blocking potential $ \psi_0 $, and on the other side by pressure of
thermal radiation. The density of electron-positron plasma in the layer
increases with time, and after short time the layer becomes a mirror for
thermal radiation of the star. The thermal radiation in the polar region under
the layer is accumulated during time $ \simeq 500 \, s $, then the plasma layer
is ejected outside. The ejection is observed as burst of radio emission formed
by the flow of relativistic electron-positron plasma.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), characterized by strong bursts of radiation
intensity at radio wavelengths lasting on the order of a millisecond, have yet
to be firmly associated with a family, or families, of astronomical sources. It
follows that despite the large number of proposed models no well-defined
physical process has been identified to explain this phenomenon. In this paper,
we demonstrate how Dicke's superradiance, for which evidence has recently been
found in the interstellar medium, can account for the characteristics
associated to FRBs. Our analysis and modelling of previously detected FRBs
suggest they could originate from regions in many ways similar to those known
to harbor masers or megamasers, and result from the coherent radiation
emanating from populations of molecules associated with large-scale entangled
quantum mechanical states. We estimate this entanglement to involve as many as
~10^(30) to ~10^(32) molecules over distances spanning 100 to 1000 AU.

Since its initial discovery, the Fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 121102 has been
found to be repeating with millisecond-duration pulses. Very recently, 15 new
bursts were detected by the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) during its continous
monitoring observations. In this letter, we show that the burst energy
distribution has a power law form which is very similar to the
Gutenberg-Richter law of earthquakes. In addition, the waiting time of the
burst has a Gaussian distribution, which is also a distinctive feature of
earthquakes. These findings suggest that the repeating FRB pulses may originate
from the starquakes of a pulsar. Noting that the soft gamma-ray repeaters
(SGRs) also exhibit such distributions, the FRB could be powered by some
mechanism associated with the SGRs, including crustal acitivity of a magnetar,
solidification-induced stresss of a young strangeon star, and
oscillation-drivern magnetic activities of a slowly rotating pulsar. These
conjectures could be tested with more repeating samples.

We analyze the sources of free electrons that produce the large dispersion
measures, DM $\approx 300-1600$ (in units cm$^{-3}$ pc), observed toward fast
radio bursts (FRBs). Individual galaxies typically produce DM $\sim 25-60$
cm$^{-3}$ pc from ionized gas in their disk, disk-halo interface, and
circumgalactic medium. Toward an FRB source at redshift $z$, a homogeneous IGM
containing a fraction $f_{\rm IGM}$ of cosmological baryons will produce DM $=
(935~{\rm cm}^{-3}~{\rm pc}) f_{\rm IGM} \, h_{70}^{-1} I(z)$, where $I(z) =
(2/3 \Omega_m)[ \{ \Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda} \}^{1/2} - 1 ]$. A
structured IGM of photoionized Ly-alpha absorbers in the cosmic web produces
similar dispersion, modeled from the observed distribution, $f_b(N,z)$, of H I
(Lya-forest) absorbers in column density and redshift with ionization
corrections and scaling relations from cosmological simulations. An analytic
formula for DM($z$) applied to observed FRB dispersions suggests that $z_{\rm
FRB} \approx 0.2-1.5$ for an IGM containing a significant baryon fraction,
$f_{\rm IGM} = 0.6\pm0.1$. Future surveys of the statistical distribution,
DM($z)$, of FRBs identified with specific galaxies and redshifts, can be used
to calibrate the IGM baryon fraction and distribution of Ly-alpha absorbers.
Fluctuations in DM at the level $\pm10$ cm$^{-3}$ pc will arise from filaments
and voids in the cosmic web.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration intense radio flares
occurring at cosmological distances. Many models have been proposed to explain
these topical astronomical events, but none has so far been confirmed. Here we
show that a novel way involving enhanced giant radio pulses from a rapidly
spun-up neutron star near a spinning black hole can explain the main properties
of non-repeating FRBs. Independent observations of such pulses, which are not
enhanced, from some Galactic pulsars make our model reliable. If correct, our
model would imply the existence of event horizons, the Lense-Thirring effect,
and a significant spin energy extraction from a black hole. Moreover, an FRB
would then probe the pulsar magnetosphere and its emission, and map the strong
gravity region near a black hole. Besides, our model predicts simultaneous
detections of FRBs and gravitational waves from black hole -- neutron star
mergers for fortuitously nearby FRB events.

ALFABURST has been searching for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) commensally with
other projects using the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver at the
Arecibo Observatory since July 2015. We describe the observing system and
report on the non-detection of any FRBs from that time until August 2017 for a
total observing time of 518 hours. With current FRB rate models, along with
measurements of telescope sensitivity and beam size, we estimate that this
survey probed redshifts out to about 3.4 with an effective survey volume of
around 600,000 Mpc$^3$. Based on this, we would expect, at the 99% confidence
level, to see at most two FRBs. We discuss the implications of this
non-detection in the context of results from other telescopes and the
limitation of our search pipeline. During the survey, single pulses from 17
known pulsars were detected. We also report the discovery of a Galactic radio
transient with a pulse width of 3 ms and dispersion measure of 281 pc
cm$^{-3}$, which was detected while the telescope was slewing between fields.

We report the discovery of four Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in the ongoing
SUrvey for Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio Bursts (SUPERB) at the Parkes Radio
Telescope: FRBs 150610, 151206, 151230 and 160102. Our real-time discoveries
have enabled us to conduct extensive, rapid multi-messenger follow-up at 12
major facilities sensitive to radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray photons and
neutrinos on time scales ranging from an hour to a few months post-burst. No
counterparts to the FRBs were found and we provide upper limits on afterglow
luminosities. None of the FRBs were seen to repeat. Formal fits to all FRBs
show hints of scattering while their intrinsic widths are unresolved in time.
FRB 151206 is at low Galactic latitude, FRB 151230 shows a sharp spectral
cutoff, and FRB 160102 has the highest dispersion measure (DM = $2596.1\pm0.3$
pc cm$^{-3}$) detected to date. Three of the FRBs have high dispersion measures
(DM >$1500$ pc cm$^{-3}$), favouring a scenario where the DM is dominated by
contributions from the Intergalactic Medium. The slope of the Parkes FRB source
counts distribution with fluences $>2$ Jyms is $\alpha=-2.2^{+0.6}_{-1.2}$ and
still consistent with a Euclidean distribution ($\alpha=-3/2$). We also find
that the all-sky rate is $1.7^{+1.5}_{-0.9}\times10^3$FRBs/($4\pi$ sr)/day
above $\sim2$ Jyms and there is currently no strong evidence for a
latitude-dependent FRB sky-rate.

The recent development of sensitive, high time resolution instruments at
radio telescopes has enabled the discovery of millisecond duration fast radio
bursts (FRBs). The FRB class encompasses a number of single pulses, many unique
in their own way, so far hindering the development of a consensus for their
origin. The key to demystifying FRBs lies in discovering many of them in
realtime in order to localise them and identity commonalities. Despite rigorous
follow-up, only one FRB has been seen to repeat suggesting the possibility of
there being two independent classes of FRBs and thus two classes of possible
progenitors. This paper discusses recent developments in the field, the FRB-GRB
connection, some of the open questions in FRB astronomy and how the next
generation telescopes are vital in the quest to understand this enigmatic
population.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have so far been detected serendipitously across the
sky. We consider the possible enhancement in the FRB rate in the direction of
galaxy clusters, and compare the predicted rate from a large sample of galaxy
clusters to the expected cosmological mean rate. We show that clusters offer
better prospects for a blind survey if the faint end of the FRB luminosity
function is steep. We find that for a telescope with a beam of ~1 deg^2, the
best targets would be either nearby clusters such as Virgo or clusters at
intermediate cosmological distances of few hundred Mpc, which offer maximal
number of galaxies per beam. We identify several galaxy clusters which have a
significant excess FRB yield compared to the cosmic mean. The two most
promising candidates are the Virgo cluster containing 1598 galaxies and located
16.5 Mpc away and S34 cluster which contains 3175 galaxies and is located at a
distance of 486 Mpc.

The fluence distribution of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population (the
"source counts" distribution, $N(>F) \propto F^\alpha$), is a crucial
diagnostic of its distance distribution, and hence the progenitor evolutionary
history. We critically reanalyse current estimates of the FRB source counts
distribution. We demonstrate that the Lorimer burst (FRB 010724) is subject to
discovery bias, and should be excluded from all statistical studies of the
population. We re-examine the evidence for flat, $\alpha >-1$, source counts
estimates based on the ratio of single-beam to multiple-beam detections with
the Parkes multi-beam receiver, and show that current data implies only a very
weak constraint of $\alpha \lesssim -1.3$. A maximum likelihood analysis
applied to the portion of the Parkes FRB population detected above the
observational completeness fluence of 2 Jy ms yields $\alpha =
-2.6_{-1.3}^{+0.7}$. Uncertainties in the location of each FRB within the
Parkes beam render estimates of the Parkes event rate uncertain in both
normalising survey area and the estimated post-beam-corrected completeness
fluence; this uncertainty needs to be accounted for when comparing the event
rate against event rates measured at other telescopes.

The repeating FRB 121102 emitted a pair of discrete bursts separated by 37 ms
and another pair, 131 days later, separated by 34 ms, during observations that
detected FRB at a mean rate of $2 \times 10^{-4}$/s. Here I assume that these
events are separate bursts rather than multiple peaks from longer single bursts
and consider their implications. They then are inconsistent with Poissonian
statistics. The measured intervals constrain any possible periodic modulation
underlying the highly episodic emission. If more such short intervals are
measured a period may be determined or periodicity may be excluded. Sources of
narrow wandering beams predict pairs (or higher multiples) of bursts closely
spaced in time compared to the mean event rate.

We study optical counterparts of a new-born pulsar in a double neutron star
system like PSR J0737-3039A/B. This system is believed to eject a small amount
of mass of $\mathcal{O}(0.1M_{\odot})$ at the second core-collapse supernova.
We argue that the initial spin of the new-born pulsar can be determined by the
orbital period at the time when the second supernova occurs. The spin angular
momentum of the progenitor is expected to be similar to that of the He-burning
core, which is tidally synchronized with the orbital motion, and then the
second remnant may be born as a millisecond pulsar. If the dipole magnetic
field strength of the nascent pulsar is comparable to that inferred from the
current spin-down rate of PSR J0737-3039B, the initial spin-down luminosity is
comparable to the luminosity of super-luminous supernovae. We consider thermal
emission arising from the supernova ejecta driven by the relativistic wind from
such a new-born pulsar. The resulting optical light curves have a rising time
$\sim 10$ days and peak luminosity $\sim 10^{44}$ erg/s. The optical emission
may last for a month to several months, due to the reprocessing of X-rays and
UV photons via photoelectric absorption. These features are broadly consistent
with those of the rapidly-rising optical transients. The high spin-down
luminosity and small ejecta mass are favorable for the progenitor of the
repeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102. We discuss a possible connection
between newborn double pulsars and fast radio bursts.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07746v2
We discuss the possibility of obtaining Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from the
interior of supernovae, in particular SN 1986J. Young neutron stars are
involved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has
been suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be
produced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using
VLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact
component not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the
first time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr
old) supernova. We show that at age 30 yr, any FRB signal at ~1 GHz would still
be largely absorbed by the ejecta. By the time the ejecta have expanded so that
a 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN
ejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion
measures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to
propagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at
distances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc. We conclude that
if FRBs originate in Type II SNe/SNRs, they would likely not become visible
till 60 ~ 200 yr after the SN explosion.

The first precise localization of a fast radio burst (FRB), leading to an
association with a low metallicity dwarf galaxy at $z=0.193$, has began to shed
light on the nature of these mysterious bursts and the physical mechanisms that
power them. Increasing the sample of FRBs with robust host galaxy associations
is the key impetus behind on-going and upcoming searches and facilities. Here,
we quantify the robustness of FRB-host galaxy associations as a function of
localization area and galaxy apparent magnitude. We also explore the use of FRB
dispersion measures to constrain the source redshift, thereby reducing the
number of candidate hosts. We further use these results to demonstrate that
even in the absence of a robust unique association, a constraint can be placed
on the maximum luminosity of a host galaxy as a function of localization area
and DM. We examine these results in the context of existing and future FRB
facilities. We find that localizations of $\lesssim 0.5''$ are required for a
chance coincidence probability of $\lesssim 1\%$ for dwarf galaxies at
$z\gtrsim 0.1$; if some hosts have luminosities of $\sim L^*$, then
localizations of up to $\approx 3''$ may suffice at $z\sim 0.1$ (but $\lesssim
1''$ at $z\approx 1$). Constraints on the redshift from the DM only marginally
improve the association probability, unless the DM is low, $\lesssim 400$ pc
cm$^{-3}$ ($z\lesssim 0.5$). This approach also relies on the determination of
galaxy redshifts, which is challenging at $z\gtrsim 0.5$ if the hosts are
generally dwarf galaxies. Finally, interesting limits on the maximum host
luminosity (for example, sufficient to demonstrate that the hosts are generally
dwarf galaxies) require localizations of $\lesssim 5''$ at $z\gtrsim 0.1$. Even
a few such localizations will shed light on the nature of FRB progenitors,
their possible diversity, and their use as cosmological tools.

We adopt and analyze results on the incidence and physical properties of
damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) to predict the astrophysical impact of gas in
galaxies on observations of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Three DLA measures form
the basis of this analysis: (i) the HI column density distribution,
parameterized as a double power-law; (ii) the incidence of DLAs with redshift
(derived here), $\ell(z)=A+B \arctan(z-C)$ with $A=0.236_{-0.021}^{+0.016},
B=0.168_{-0.017}^{+0.010}, C=2.87_{-0.13}^{+0.17}$ and (iii) the electron
density, parameterized as a log-normal deviate with mean $10^{-2.6} cm^{-3}$
and dispersion 0.3dex. Synthesizing these results, we estimate that the average
rest-frame dispersion measure from the neutral medium of a single, intersecting
galaxy is DM$^{NM}_{DLA}=0.25$ pc/cm^3. Analysis of AlIII and CII* absorption
limits the putative warm ionized medium to contribute
DM$^{WIM}_{DLA}<20$pc/cm^3. Given the low incidence of DLAs, we find that a
population of FRBs at z=2 will incur DM(z=2)=0.01 pc/cm^3 on average, with a
99% c.l. upper bound of 0.22 pc/cm^3. Assuming that turbulence of the ISM in
external galaxies is qualitatively similar to our Galaxy, we estimate that the
angular broadening of an FRB by intersecting galaxies is negligible
($\theta<0.1$mas). The temporal broadening is also predicted to be small, $\tau
\approx 0.3$ms for a z=1 galaxy intersecting a z=2 FRB for an observing
frequency of $\nu=1$GHz. Even with $\nu=600$MHz, the fraction of sightlines
broadened beyond 25ms is only approximately 0.1%. We conclude that gas within
the ISM of intervening galaxies has a minor effect on the detection of FRBs and
their resultant DM distributions. Download the repository at

Here, we present initial results from the ALFABURST radio transient survey,
which is currently running in a commensal mode with the ALFA receiver at the
Arecibo telescope. We observed for a total of 1400 hours and have detected
single pulses from known pulsars but did not detect any FRBs. The non-detection
of FRBs is consistent with the current FRB sky rates.

Fast radio bursts are a new class of transient radio phenomena currently
detected as millisecond radio pulses with very high dispersion measures. As new
radio surveys begin searching for FRBs a large population is expected to be
detected in real-time, triggering a range of multi-wavelength and
multi-messenger telescopes to search for repeating bursts and/or associated
emission. Here we propose a method for disseminating FRB triggers using Virtual
Observatory Events (VOEvents). This format was developed and is used
successfully for transient alerts across the electromagnetic spectrum and for
multi-messenger signals such as gravitational waves. In this paper we outline a
proposed VOEvent standard for FRBs that includes the essential parameters of
the event and where these parameters should be specified within the structure
of the event. An additional advantage to the use of VOEvents for FRBs is that
the events can automatically be ingested into the FRB Catalogue (FRBCAT)
enabling real-time updates for public use. We welcome feedback from the
community on the proposed standard outlined below and encourage those
interested to join the nascent working group forming around this topic.

I present an empirical study of the properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs):
Gigahertz-frequency, dispersed pulses of extragalactic origin. I focus my
investigation on the sample of seventeen FRBs detected at the Parkes radio
telescope with largely self-consistent instrumentation. Of this sample, six are
temporally unresolved, eight exhibit evidence for scattering in inhomogeneous
plasma, and five display potentially intrinsic temporal structure. The
characteristic scattering timescales at a frequency of 1 GHz range between
0.005 ms and 32 ms; moderate evidence exists for a relation between FRB
scattering timescales and dispersion measures. Additionally, I present
constraints on the fluences of Parkes FRBs, accounting for their uncertain
sky-positions, and use the multiple-beam detection of FRB 010724 (the Lorimer
burst) to measure its fluence to be $800\pm400$ Jy ms. FRBs, including the
repeating FRB 121102, appear to manifest with a plethora of characteristics,
and it is uncertain at present whether they share a common class of progenitor
object, or arise from a selection of independent progenitors.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) last for $\sim $ few milli-seconds and, hence, are
likely to arise from the gravitational collapse of supra-massive, spinning
neutron stars after they lose the centrifugal support (Falcke \& Rezzolla
2014). In this paper, we provide arguments to show that the repeating burst,
FRB 121102, can also be modeled in the collapse framework provided the
supra-massive object implodes either into a Kerr black hole surrounded by
highly magnetized plasma or into a strange quark star. Since the estimated
rates of FRBs and SN Ib/c are comparable, we put forward a common progenitor
scenario for FRBs and long GRBs in which only those compact remnants entail
prompt $\gamma $-emission whose kick velocities are almost aligned or
anti-aligned with the stellar spin axes. In such a scenario, emission of
detectable gravitational radiation and, possibly, of neutrinos are expected to
occur during the SN Ib/c explosion as well as, later, at the time of magnetar
implosion.

With the installation of a new phased array system called Apertif, the
instantaneous field of view of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT)
has increased to 8.7$\,$deg$^2$. This system has turned the WSRT in to an
highly effective telescope to conduct Fast Radio Burst (FRB) and pulsar
surveys. To exploit this advantage, an advanced and real-time backend, called
the Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS), is being developed and commissioned
at the WSRT. In addition to the real-time detection of FRBs, ARTS will localize
the events to about 1/2600 of the field of view --- essential information for
identifying the nature of FRBs. ARTS will also trigger real-time follow up with
LOFAR of newly detected FRBs, to achieve localization at arcsecond precision.
We review the upcoming time-domain surveys with Apertif, and present the
current status of the ongoing commissioning of the time domain capabilities of
Apertif.

We undertook coordinated campaigns with the Green Bank, Effelsberg, and
Arecibo radio telescopes during Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton
observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 to search for
simultaneous radio and X-ray bursts. We find 12 radio bursts from FRB 121102
during 70 ks total of X-ray observations. We detect no X-ray photons at the
times of radio bursts from FRB 121102 and further detect no X-ray bursts above
the measured background at any time. We place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of
$3\times10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ on the 0.5--10 keV fluence for X-ray bursts at
the time of radio bursts for durations $<700$ ms, which corresponds to a burst
energy of $4\times10^{45}$ erg at the measured distance of FRB 121102. We also
place limits on the 0.5--10 keV fluence of $5\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ and
$1\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for bursts emitted at any time during the
XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, respectively, assuming a typical X-ray
burst duration of 5 ms. We analyze data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit on the
10--100 keV fluence of $4\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ ($5\times10^{47}$ erg at
the distance of FRB 121102) for gamma-ray bursts at the time of radio bursts.
We also present a deep search for a persistent X-ray source using all of the
X-ray observations taken to date and place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit on the
0.5--10 keV flux of $4\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\times10^{41}$
erg~s$^{-1}$ at the distance of FRB 121102). We discuss these non-detections in
the context of the host environment of FRB 121102 and of possible sources of
fast radio bursts in general.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are quickly becoming a subject of intense interest
in time-domain astronomy. The progenitors of FRBs remain unknown but a wide
variety of models exist from cataclysmic to repeating scenarios. Advances in
FRB detection using current and next-generation radio telescopes will enable
the growth of the population in the next few years. Real-time discovery of FRBs
is now possible with 6 sources detected in real-time within the past 2 years at
the Parkes telescope. Here we discuss the developing strategies for maximising
real-time science with FRBs including polarisation capture and multi-wavelength
follow-up, with particular focus on real-time detections with the Parkes
telescope as a test bed for fast radio burst science. We also discuss how our
response to these events can pave the way for the next generation of FRB
searches with wide-field interferometers.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06103v2
Given the possible repetitive nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), their
cosmological origin, and their high occurrence, detection of strongly lensed
sources due to intervening galaxy lenses is possible with forthcoming radio
surveys. We show that if multiple images of a repeating source are resolved
with VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could
reveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot.
This can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments,
constraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if
FRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions
for which the location of the emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing
precision possible for FRBs ($\sim {\rm ms}$) compared to the typical time
delays between images in galaxy lensing ($\gtrsim 10\, {\rm days}$) enables the
measurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays ($\sim 10^{-9}$), and
hence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions
between the source, the lens, and the Earth. We show that uniform cosmic
peculiar velocities only cause the delay time to drift linearly, and that the
effect from the Earth's orbital motion can be accurately subtracted, thus
enabling a search for non-trivial source motion. For a timing accuracy of $\sim
1\,$ms and a repetition rate (of detected bursts) $\sim 0.05$ per day of a
single FRB source, non-uniform displacement $\gtrsim 0.1 - 1\,$AU of the
emission spot perpendicular to the line of sight is detectable if repetitions
are seen over a period of hundreds of days.

The distribution of FRB fluxes and fluences is characterized by a few very
bright events and a deficiency of fainter events compared to expectations for a
homogeneous space-filling distribution. I define a metric to quantify this, and
apply it to the 17 presently known Parkes FRB, products of a comparatively
homogeneous search. With 98\% confidence we reject the hypothesis of a
homogeneous distribution in Euclidean space. Possible explanations include a
reduction of fainter events by cosmological redshifts or evolution or a
cosmologically local concentration of events. The former is opposed by the
small value of the one known FRB redshift. The latter contradicts the
Cosmological Principle, but may be explained if the brighter FRB originate in
the Local Supercluster.

Recently, a precise (sub-arcsecond) localization of the repeating fast radio
burst (FRB) 121102 has led to the discovery of persistent radio and optical
counterparts, the identification of a host dwarf galaxy at a redshift of
$z=0.193$, and several campaigns of searches for higher-frequency counterparts,
which gave only upper limits on the emission flux. Although the origin of FRBs
remains unknown, most of the existing theoretical models are associated with
pulsars, or more specifically, magnetars. In this paper, we explore persistent
high-energy emission from a rapidly rotating highly magnetized pulsar
associated with FRB 121102 if internal gradual magnetic dissipation occurs in
the pulsar wind. We find that the efficiency of converting the spin-down
luminosity to the high-energy (e.g., X-ray) luminosity is generally much
smaller than unity, even for a millisecond magnetar. This provides an
explanation for the non-detection of high-energy counterparts to FRB 121102. We
further constrain the spin period and surface magnetic field strength of the
pulsar with the current high-energy observations. In addition, we compare our
results with the constraints given by the other methods in previous works and
would expect to apply our new method to some other open issues in the future.

The Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) is an 18,000 square meter
radio telescope situated some 40 km from the city of Canberra, Australia. Its
operating band (820-850 MHz) is now partly allocated to mobile phone
communications, making radio astronomy challenging. We describe how the
deployment of new digital receivers (RX boxes), Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) based filterbanks and server-class computers equipped with 43 GPUs
(Graphics Processing Units) has transformed MOST into a versatile new
instrument (the UTMOST) for studying the dynamic radio sky on millisecond
timescales, ideal for work on pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The
filterbanks, servers and their high-speed, low-latency network form part of a
hybrid solution to the observatory's signal processing requirements. The
emphasis on software and commodity off-the-shelf hardware has enabled rapid
deployment through the re-use of proven 'software backends' for its signal
processing. The new receivers have ten times the bandwidth of the original MOST
and double the sampling of the line feed, which doubles the field of view. The
UTMOST can simultaneously excise interference, make maps, coherently dedisperse
pulsars, and perform real-time searches of coherent fan beams for dispersed
single pulses. Although system performance is still sub-optimal, a pulsar
timing and FRB search programme has commenced and the first UTMOST maps have
been made. The telescope operates as a robotic facility, deciding how to
efficiently target pulsars and how long to stay on source, via feedback from
real-time pulsar folding. The regular timing of over 300 pulsars has resulted
in the discovery of 7 pulsar glitches and 3 FRBs. The UTMOST demonstrates that
if sufficient signal processing can be applied to the voltage streams it is
possible to perform innovative radio science in hostile radio frequency
environments.

Recent multi-telescope observations of the repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB
121102 reveal a Gaussian-like spectral profile and associate the event with a
dwarf metal-poor galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19. Assuming that this
event represents the entire FRB population, we make predictions for the
expected number counts of FRBs observable by future radio telescopes between 50
MHz and 3.5 GHz. We vary our model assumptions to bracket the expected rate of
FRBs, and find that it exceeds one FRB per second per sky when accounting for
faint sources. We show that future low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the
Square Kilometer Array, could detect more than one FRB per minute over the
entire sky originating from the epoch of reionization.

The MAGIC telescopes are a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes (IACTs) designed to observe very high energy (VHE) gamma rays above
~50 GeV. However, as IACTs are sensitive to Cherenkov light in the UV/blue and
use photo-detectors with a time response well below the ms scale, MAGIC is also
able to perform simultaneous optical observations. Through an alternative
system installed in the central PMT of MAGIC II camera, the so-called central
pixel, MAGIC is sensitive to short (1ms - 1s) optical pulses. Periodic signals
from the Crab pulsar are regularly monitored. Here we report for the first time
the experimental determination of the sensitivity of the central pixel to
isolated 1-10 ms long optical pulses. The result of this study is relevant for
searches of fast transients such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).

The cosmic proper distance $d_P$ is a fundamental distance in the Universe.
Unlike the luminosity and angular diameter distances, which correspond to the
angular size, the proper distance is the length of light path from the source
to observer. However, the proper distance has not been measured before. The
recent redshift measurement of a repeat fast radio burst (FRB) can shed light
on the proper distance. We show that the proper distance-redshift relation can
indeed be derived from dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs with measured
redshifts. From Monte Carlo simulations, we find that about 500 FRBs with DM
and redshift measurements can tightly constrain the proper distance-redshift
relation. We also show that the curvature of our Universe can be constrained
with a model-independent method using this derived proper distance-redshift
relation and the observed angular diameter distances. Owing to the high event
rate of FRBs, hundreds of FRBs can be discovered in the future by upcoming
instruments. The proper distance will play an important role in investigating
the accelerating expansion and the geometry of the Universe.

We present a search for optical bursts from the repeating fast radio burst
FRB 121102 using simultaneous observations with the high-speed optical camera
ULTRASPEC on the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope and radio observations with the
100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope. A total of 13 radio bursts were detected, but
we found no evidence for corresponding optical bursts in our 70.7-ms frames.
The 5-sigma upper limit to the optical flux density during our observations is
0.33 mJy at 767nm. This gives an upper limit for the optical burst fluence of
0.046 Jy ms, which constrains the broadband spectral index of the burst
emission to alpha < -0.2. Two of the radio pulses are separated by just 34 ms,
which may represent an upper limit on a possible underlying periodicity (a
rotation period typical of pulsars), or these pulses may have come from a
single emission window that is a small fraction of a possible period.

The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 was recently localized in a dwarf
galaxy at a cosmological distance. The dispersion measure (DM) derived for each
burst from FRB 121102 so far has not shown significant evolution, even though
an apparent increase was recently seen with newly detected VLA bursts. It is
expected that more repeating FRB sources may be detected in the future. In this
work, we investigate a list of possible astrophysical processes that might
cause DM variation of a particular FRB source. The processes include (1) the
cosmological scale effects such as Hubble expansion and large-scale structure
fluctuations; (2) the FRB local effects such as gas density fluctuation,
expansion of a supernova remnant, a pulsar wind nebula, and an HII region; and
(3) the propagation effect due to plasma lensing. We find that the DM
variations contributed by the large-scale structure are extremely small, and
any observable DM variation is likely caused by the plasma local to the FRB
source. Besides mechanisms that produce decreasing DM with time, we suggest
that an FRB source in an expanding supernova remnant around a nearly neutral
ambient medium during the deceleration (Sedov-Taylor and snowplow) phases or in
a growing HII region can introduce DM increasing. Some effects (e.g. an FRB
source moving in an HII region or plasma lensing) can give either positive or
negative DM variations. Future observations of DM variations of FRB 121102 and
other repeating FRB sources can bring important clues for the physical origin
of these sources.

Recent localization of the repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 121102 revealed
the distance of its host galaxy and luminosities of the bursts. We investigated
constraints on the young neutron star (NS) model, that (a) the FRB intrinsic
luminosity is supported by the spin-down energy, and (b) the FRB duration is
shorter than the NS rotation period. In the case of a circular cone emission
geometry, conditions (a) and (b) determine the NS parameters within very small
ranges, compared with that from only condition (a) discussed in previous works.
Anisotropy of the pulsed emission does not affect the area of the allowed
parameter region by virtue of condition (b). The determined parameters are
consistent with those independently limited by the properties of the possible
persistent radio counterpart and the circumburst environments such as
surrounding materials. Since the NS in the allowed parameter region is older
than the spin-down timescale, the hypothetical GRP-like model expects a rapid
radio flux decay of $\lesssim1$ Jy within a few years as the spin-down
luminosity decreases. The continuous monitoring will give a hint of
discrimination of the models. If no flux evolution will be seen, we need to
consider an alternative model, e.g., the magnetically powered flare.

Fast radio bursts are bright, unresolved and short flashes of radio emission
originating from outside the Milky Way. The origin of these mysterious
outbursts is unknown, but their high luminosity and short duration has prompted
much speculation. The discovery that FRB 121102 repeats has enabled
multiwavelength follow up, which has identified the host galaxy. VERITAS has
observed the location of FRB 121102, including coincident observations with
Arecibo. We present the results of a search for steady very high energy
gamma-ray emission and the methodology for searching for short timescale,
transient optical and very high energy gamma-ray emission.

We present a search for neutrinos in coincidence in time and direction with
four fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Parkes and Green Bank radio
telescopes during the first year of operation of the complete IceCube Neutrino
Observatory (May 2011 through May 2012). The neutrino sample consists of
138,322 muon neutrino candidate events, which are dominated by atmospheric
neutrinos and muons but also contain an astrophysical neutrino component.
Considering only neutrinos detected on the same day as each FRB, zero IceCube
events were found to be compatible with the FRB directions within the estimated
99\% error radius of the neutrino directions. Based on the non-detection, we
present the first upper limits on the neutrino fluence from fast radio bursts.

The localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 121102,
suggests that it is associated with a persistent radio-luminous compact source
in the FRB host galaxy. Using the FIRST radio catalog, I present a search for
luminous persistent sources in nearby galaxies, with radio luminosities >10% of
the FRB 121102 persistent source luminosity. The galaxy sample contains about
30% of the total galaxy g-band luminosity within <108 Mpc, in a footprint of
10,600 deg^2. After rejecting sources likely due to active galactic nuclei
activity or background sources, I remain with 11 candidates that are presumably
associated with galactic disks or star formation regions. At least some of
these candidates are likely to be due to chance alignment. In addition, I find
85 sources within 1" of galactic nuclei. Assuming the radio persistent sources
are not related to galactic nuclei and that they follow the galaxy g-band
light, the 11 sources imply a 95% confidence upper limit on the space density
of luminous persistent sources of <5x10^-5 Mpc^-3, and that at any given time
only a small fraction of galaxies host a radio luminous persistent source
(<10^-3 L_*^-1). Assuming persistent sources life time of 100 yr, this implies
a birth rate of <5x10^-7 yr^-1 Mpc^-3. Given the FRB volumetric rate, and
assuming that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources,
this sets a lower limit on the rate of FRB events per persistent source of >0.8
yr^-1. I argue that these 11 candidates are good targets for FRB searches and I
estimate the FRB event rate from these candidates.

We report on a search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Green Bank
Northern Celestial Cap (GBNCC) Pulsar Survey at 350 MHz. Pointings amounting to
a total on-sky time of 61 days were searched to a DM of 3000 pc cm$^{-3}$ while
the rest (23 days; 29% of the total time) were searched to a DM of 500 pc
cm$^{-3}$. No FRBs were detected in the pointings observed through May 2016. We
estimate a 95% confidence upper limit on the FRB rate of $3.6\times 10^3$ FRBs
sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux density of 0.63 Jy at 350 MHz for an
intrinsic pulse width of 5 ms. We place constraints on the spectral index
$\alpha$ by running simulations for different astrophysical scenarios and
cumulative flux density distributions. The non-detection with GBNCC is
consistent with the 1.4-GHz rate reported for the Parkes surveys for $\alpha >
+0.35 $ in the absence of scattering and free-free absorption and $\alpha >
-0.3$ in the presence of scattering, for a Euclidean flux distribution. The
constraints imply that FRBs exhibit either a flat spectrum or a spectral
turnover at frequencies above 400 MHz. These constraints also allow estimation
of the number of bursts that can be detected with current and upcoming surveys.
We predict that CHIME may detect anywhere from several to $\sim$50 FRBs a day
(depending on model assumptions), making it well suited for interesting
constraints on spectral index, the log $N$-log $S$ slope and pulse profile
evolution across its bandwidth (400-800 MHz).

The localization of the repeating FRB 121102 to a low-metallicity dwarf
galaxy at $z=0.193$, and its association with a quiescent radio source,
suggests the possibility that FRBs originate from magnetars, formed by the
unusual supernovae in such galaxies. We investigate this via a comparison of
magnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We
calculate average volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production
channels such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via core-collapse supernovae.
For each channel we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics using
their known properties. We determine for the first time the number density of
FRB emitters (the product of their volumetric birthrate and lifetime), $R_{\rm
FRB}\tau\approx 10^4$Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming that FRBs are predominantly emitted
from repetitive sources similar to FRB 121102 and adopting a beaming factor of
0.1. By comparing rates we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe, GRBs)
implies a typical FRB lifetime of $\approx$30-300 yr, in good agreement with
other lines of argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent
with the available energy stored in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any
relation to magnetars produced via normal core-collapse supernovae leads to a
very short lifetime of $\approx$0.5yr, in conflict with both theory and
observation. We demonstrate that due to the diverse host galaxy distributions
of the different progenitor channels, many possible sources of FRB birth can be
ruled out with $\lesssim 10$ host galaxy identifications. Conversely, targeted
searches of galaxies that have previously hosted decades-old SLSNe and GRBs may
be a fruitful strategy for discovering new FRBs and related quiescent radio
sources, and determining the nature of their progenitors.

We present the H$\alpha$ intensity map of the host galaxy of the repeating
fast radio burst FRB 121102 at a redshift of z=0.193 obtained with the
AO-assisted Kyoto 3DII optical integral-field unit mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru
Telescope. We detected a compact H$\alpha$-emitting (i.e., star-forming) region
in the galaxy, which has a much smaller angular size [$< 0".57$ (1.9 kpc) at
full width at half maximum (FWHM)] than the extended stellar continuum emission
region determined by the Gemini/GMOS z'-band image [$\simeq 1".4$ (4.6 kpc) at
FWHM with ellipticity b/a=0.45]. The spatial offset between the centroid of the
H$\alpha$ emission region and the position of the radio bursts is $0".08 \pm
0".02$ ($0.26 \pm 0.07$ kpc), indicating that FRB 121102 is located within the
star-forming region. This close spatial association of FRB 121102 with the
star-forming region is consistent with expectations from young pulsar/magnetar
models for FRB 121102, and it also suggests that the observed H$\alpha$
emission region can make a major dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the
host galaxy DM component of FRB 121102. Nevertheless, the largest possible
value of the DM contribution from the H$\alpha$ emission region inferred from
our observations still requires a significant amount of ionized baryons in
intergalactic medium (the so-called `missing' baryons) as the DM source of FRB
121102, and we obtain a 90\% confidence level lower limit on the cosmic baryon
density in the intergalactic medium in the low-redshift universe as
$\Omega_{IGM} > 0.012$.

The persistent radio counterpart of FRB 121102 is estimated to have $N\sim
10^{52}$ particles, energy $E_N\sim 10^{48}$ erg, and size $R\sim 10^{17}$ cm.
The source can be a nebula inflated and heated by an intermittent outflow from
a magnetar --- a neutron star powered by its magnetic (rather than rotational)
energy. The object is young and frequently liberating energy in magnetic flares
driven by accelerated ambipolar diffusion in the neutron star core, feeding the
nebula and producing bright millisecond bursts. The particle number in the
nebula is consistent with ion ejecta from giant flares. The nebula may also
contain the freeze-out of electron-positron pairs $N_\pm\sim 10^{51}$ created
months after the neutron star birth; the same mechanism offers an explanation
for $N_\pm$ in the Crab nebula. The persistent source around FRB 121102 is
likely heated by magnetic dissipation and internal waves excited by the
magnetar ejecta. The volumetric heating by waves explains the nebula's enormous
efficiency in producing radio emission. The repeating radio bursts are
suggested to occur much closer to the magnetar, whose flaring magnetosphere
drives ultrarelativistic internal shocks into the magnetar wind. The shocks are
mediated by Larmor rotation that forms a GHz maser with the observed ms
duration. Furthermore, the flare ejecta can become charge-starved and then
convert to electromagnetic waves.

A hypothetical photon mass, $m_\gamma$, gives an energy-dependent light speed
in a Lorentz-invariant theory. Such a modification causes an additional time
delay between photons of different energies when they travel through a fixed
distance. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their short time duration and
cosmological propagation distance, are excellent astrophysical objects to
constrain $m_\gamma$. Here for the first time we develop a Bayesian framework
to study this problem with a catalog of FRBs. Those FRBs with and without
redshift measurement are both useful in this framework, and can be combined in
a Bayesian way. A catalog of 21 FRBs (including 20 FRBs without redshift
measurement, and one, FRB 121102, with a measured redshift $z=0.19273 \pm
0.00008$) give a combined limit $m_\gamma \leq 8.7 \times 10^{-51}\, {\rm kg}$,
or equivalently $m_\gamma \leq 4.9 \times 10^{-15}\, {\rm eV}/c^2$ ($m_\gamma
\leq 1.5\times10^{-50} \, {\rm kg}$, or equivalently $m_\gamma \leq 8.4 \times
10^{-15} \,{\rm eV}/c^2$) at 68% (95%) confidence level, which represents the
best limit that comes purely from kinematics. The framework proposed here will
be valuable when FRBs are observed daily in the future. Increment in the number
of FRBs, and refinement in the knowledge about the electron distributions in
the Milky Way, the host galaxies of FRBs, and the intergalactic median, will
further tighten the constraint.

Macroscopic magnetic dipoles are considered as cosmic dark matter. Permanent
magnetism in relativistic field structures can involve some form of
superconductivity, one example being current-carrying string loops (`springs')
with vanishing net tension. We derive the cross section for free classical
dipoles to collide, finding it depends weakly on orientation when mutual
precession is rapid. The collision rate of `spring' loops with tension ${\cal
T} \sim 10^{-8}c^4/G$ in galactic halos approaches the measured rate of fast
radio bursts (FRBs) if the loops comprise most of the dark matter. A large
superconducting dipole (LSD) with mass $\sim 10^{20}$ g and size $\sim 1$ mm
will form a $\sim 100$ km magnetosphere moving through interstellar plasma.
Although hydromagnetic drag is generally weak, it is strong enough to capture
some LSDs into long-lived rings orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that
form by the direct collapse of massive gas clouds. Repeated collisions near
young SMBHs could dominate the global collision rate, thereby broadening the
dipole mass spectrum. Colliding LSDs produce tiny, hot electromagnetic
explosions. The accompanying paper shows that these explosions couple
effectively to propagating low-frequency electromagnetic modes, with output
peaking at 0.01-1 THz. We describe several constraints on, and predictions of,
LSDs as cosmic dark matter. The shock formed by an infalling LSD triggers
self-sustained thermonuclear burning in a C/O (ONeMg) white dwarf (WD) of mass
$\gtrsim 1\,M_\odot$ ($1.3\,M_\odot$). The spark is generally located well off
the center of the WD. The rate of LSD-induced explosions matches the observed
rate of Type Ia supernovae.

The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source that produced FRB 121102 was
recently localized in a star forming galaxy at $z=0.193$, which is associated
with an extended radio source at the burst location. One possibility is that
the repeating FRBs are produced by a new-born magnetar, which also powers the
radio nebula. If so, the magnetar may produce $\gamma$-ray emission due to
magnetic dipolar spin-down. The luminosity depends on the magnetar spin
parameters and age. We process the eight-year Fermi LAT data at the position of
FRB 121102 and place an energy flux upper limit of $\sim 10^{-11} \ {\rm erg \
cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$ in time bins with six-month intervals, and an accumulated
energy flux upper limit of $\sim 4\times 10^{-12} \ {\rm erg \ cm^{-2} \
s^{-1}}$ over the eight year span. The corresponding $\gamma$-ray luminosity
upper limits are $\sim 10^{45} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ and $\sim 4\times 10^{44}
\ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ for the time-resolved and time-integrated analyses,
respectively. We discuss the implications of these limits on the young magnetar
model.

We derive stringent constraints on the persistent source associated with FRB
121102: Size $10^{17}$ cm $<R<10^{18}$ cm, age $<300$ yr, characteristic
electron energy $\varepsilon_e\sim0.3$ GeV, total energy $\sim10^{49}$ erg. The
hot radiating plasma is confined by a cold plasma of mass $M_c<0.03
(R/10^{17.5}{\rm cm})^4 M_\odot$. The source is nearly resolved, and may be
resolved by 10 GHz observations. The fact that $\varepsilon_e\sim m_p c^2$
suggests that the hot plasma was created by the ejection of a mildly
relativistic, $M\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ shell, which propagated into an extended
ambient medium or collided with a pre-ejected shell of mass $M_c$. The inferred
plasma properties are inconsistent with typical "magnetar wind nebulae" model
predictions.
  We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of FRBs (independent of
the persistent source model): Ejection from an underlying compact object,
$R_s\sim10^{6}$ cm, of highly relativistic shells, with energy $E_s=10^{41}$
erg and Lorentz factor $\gamma_s$~$10^3$, into a surrounding e-p plasma with
density $n\sim0.1/cm^3$ (consistent with that inferred for the plasma producing
the persistent emission associated with FRB 121102). Such shell ejections with
energy typical for FRB events lead to plasma conditions appropriate for strong
synchrotron maser emission at the GHz range, $\nu_{
coh.}\sim0.5(E/10^{41}erg)^{1/4}$ GHz. In this model, a significant fraction of
the deposited energy is converted to an FRB with duration $R_s/c$, accompanied
by ~10 MeV photons carrying less energy than the FRB.
  The inferred energy and mass associated with the source are low compared to
those of typical supernova ejecta. This may suggest some type of a "weak
stellar explosion", where a neutron star is formed with relatively low mass and
energy ejection. However, the current upper limit on R does not allow one to
rule out $M_c\sim1M_\odot$.

We present optical, near- and mid-infrared imaging of the host galaxy of FRB
121102 with the Gemini North telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The FRB 121102 host galaxy is resolved, revealing a
bright star forming region located in the outskirts of the irregular,
low-metallicity dwarf galaxy. The star forming region has a half-light radius
of 0.68 kpc (0.20 arcsec), encompassing the projected location of the compact
(<0.7 pc), persistent radio source that is associated with FRB 121102. The
half-light diameter of the dwarf galaxy is 5 to 7 kpc, and broadband spectral
energy distribution fitting indicates that it has a total stellar mass of
M*~10^8 Msun. The metallicity of the host galaxy is low, 12+log10
([O/H])=8.0+-0.1. The properties of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 are
comparable to those of extreme emission line galaxies, also known to host
hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The
projected location of FRB 121102 within the star forming region supports the
proposed connection of FRBs with newly born neutron stars or magnetars.

We report the detection of an ultra-bright fast radio burst (FRB) from a
modest, 3.4-day pilot survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder. The survey was conducted in a wide-field fly's-eye configuration
using the phased-array-feed technology deployed on the array to instantaneously
observe an effective area of $160$ deg$^2$, and achieve an exposure totaling
$13200$ deg$^2$ hr. We constrain the position of FRB 170107 to a region
$8'\times8'$ in size (90% containment) and its fluence to be $58\pm6$ Jy ms.
The spectrum of the burst shows a sharp cutoff above $1400$ MHz, which could be
either due to scintillation or an intrinsic feature of the burst. This confirms
the existence of an ultra-bright ($>20$ Jy ms) population of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07553v1
We present results of the coordinated observing campaign that made the first
subarcsecond localization of a Fast Radio Burst, FRB 121102. During this
campaign, we made the first simultaneous detection of an FRB burst by multiple
telescopes: the VLA at 3 GHz and the Arecibo Observatory at 1.4 GHz. Of the
nine bursts detected by the Very Large Array at 3 GHz, four had simultaneous
observing coverage at other observatories. We use multi-observatory constraints
and modeling of bursts seen only at 3 GHz to confirm earlier results showing
that burst spectra are not well modeled by a power law. We find that burst
spectra are characterized by a ~500 MHz envelope and apparent radio energy as
high as $10^{40}$ erg. We measure significant changes in the apparent
dispersion between bursts that can be attributed to frequency-dependent
profiles or some other intrinsic burst structure that adds a systematic error
to the estimate of DM by up to 1%. We use FRB 121102 as a prototype of the FRB
class to estimate a volumetric birth rate of FRB sources $R_{FRB} \approx
5x10^{-5}/N_r$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, where $N_r$ is the number of bursts per
source over its lifetime. This rate is broadly consistent with models of FRBs
from young pulsars or magnetars born in superluminous supernovae or long
gamma-ray bursts, if the typical FRB repeats on the order of thousands of times
during its lifetime.

The non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) could arise from catastrophic
stellar explosions or magnetar giant flares, so relativistic blast waves might
be produced in these events. Motivated by this, we here search for GeV
counterparts to all non-repeating FRBs with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT),
including FRB 131104 that is claimed to be possibly associated with a gamma-ray
transient candidate detected by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). FRB 131104
enters the field of view (FoV) of LAT ~5000s after the burst time, so we are
only able to search for the GeV afterglow emission during this period, but no
significant GeV emission is detected. We also perform a search for GeV
emissions from other FRBs, but no significant GeV emissions are detected
either. Upper limit fluences in the range of (4.7-29.2)x10^(-7) erg/cm2 are
obtained, and then the upper limits of the isotropic blast wave kinetic energy
of about (1-200)x10^(53) erg are inferred under certain assumptions. Although
the current limits on the isotropic blast wave energy are not sufficiently
stringent to rule out the connection between FRBs and GRB-like transients,
future more sensitive observations with Fermi or Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes might be able to constrain the connection.

The repeating FRB 121102, the only FRB with an accurately determined
position, is associated with a variable persistent radio source consistent with
a low luminosity active galactic nucleus. I suggest that FRB originate in the
accretion disc funnels of intermediate mass black holes. Narrowly collimated
radiation is emitted along the wandering instantaneous angular momentum axis of
accreted matter. We observe this emission as a fast radio burst when it sweeps
across the direction to the observer. This model constrains the mass of the
black hole to values below those of galactic nuclei. It predicts, in contrast
to neutron star (pulsar or SGR) models, that repeating FRB will not be periodic
and will be co-located with persistent but variable radio sources resulting
from the off-axis emission. The model is analogous, on smaller spatial, lower
mass and accretion rate and shorter temporal scales, to AGN making double radio
sources, with FRB corresponding to blazars in which the jets point toward us.

We report on the discovery of a new fast radio burst, FRB 150215, with the
Parkes radio telescope on 2015 February 15. The burst was detected in real time
with a dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6$\pm$0.8 pc cm^{-3}, a pulse duration
of 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5} ms, and a measured peak flux density assuming the burst
was at beam center of 0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} Jy. The FRB originated at a Galactic
longitude and latitude of 24.66^{\circ}, 5.28^{\circ}, 25 degrees away from the
Galactic Center. The burst was found to be 43$\pm$5% linearly polarized with a
rotation measure (RM) in the range -9 < RM < 12 rad m^{-2} (95% confidence
level), consistent with zero. The burst was followed-up with 11 telescopes to
search for radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino emission. Neither
transient nor variable emission was found to be associated with the burst and
no repeat pulses have been observed in 17.25 hours of observing. The sightline
to the burst is close to the Galactic plane and the observed physical
properties of FRB 150215 demonstrate the existence of sight lines of
anomalously low RM for a given electron column density. The Galactic RM
foreground may approach a null value due to magnetic field reversals along the
line of sight, a decreased total electron column density from the Milky Way, or
some combination of these effects. A lower Galactic DM contribution might
explain why this burst was detectable whereas previous searches at low latitude
have had lower detection rates than those out of the plane.

Einstein's weak equivalence principle (WEP) states that any freely falling,
uncharged test particle follows the same identical trajectory independent of
its internal structure and composition. Since the polarization of a photon is
considered to be part of its internal structure, we propose that polarized
photons from astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and fast
radio bursts (FRBs), can be used to constrain the accuracy of the WEP through
the Shapiro time delay effect. Assuming that the arrival time delays of photons
with different polarizations are mainly attributed to the gravitational
potential of the Laniakea supercluster of galaxies, we show that a strict upper
limit on the differences of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$
value for the polarized optical emission of GRB 120308A is
$\Delta\gamma<1.2\times10^{-10}$, for the polarized gamma-ray emission of GRB
100826A is $\Delta\gamma<1.2\times10^{-10}$, and for the polarized radio
emission of FRB 150807 is $\Delta\gamma<2.2\times10^{-16}$. These are the first
direct verifications of the WEP for multiband photons with different
polarizations. In particular, the result from FRB 150807 provides the most
stringent limit to date on a deviation from the WEP, improving by one order of
magnitude the previous best result based on Crab pulsar photons with different
energies.

We study stock market instability by using cross-correlations constructed
from the return time series of 366 stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
from January 5, 1998 to December 30, 2013. To investigate the dynamical
evolution of the cross-correlations, cross-correlation matrices are calculated
with a rolling window of 400 days. To quantify the volatile market stages where
the potential risk is high, we apply the principal components analysis and
measure the cumulative risk fraction (CRF), which is the system variance
associated with the first few principal components. From the CRF, we detected
three volatile market stages corresponding to the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers, the 2011 Tohoku Region Pacific Coast Earthquake, and the FRB QE3
reduction observation in the study period. We further apply the random matrix
theory for the risk analysis and find that the first eigenvector is more

Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are transient sources of unknown origin. Recent
radio and optical observations have provided strong evidence for an
extragalactic origin of the phenomenon and the precise localization of the
repeating FRB 121102. Observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) have revealed the existence
of a continuum non-thermal radio source consistent with the location of the
bursts in a dwarf galaxy. All these new data rule out several models that were
previously proposed, and impose stringent constraints to new models. We aim to
model FRB 121102 in light of the new observational results in the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) scenario. We propose a model for repeating FRBs in which
a non-steady relativistic $e^\pm$-beam, accelerated by an impulsive
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-driven mechanism, interacts with a cloud at the
centre of a star-forming dwarf galaxy. The interaction generates regions of
high electrostatic field called cavitons in the plasma cloud. Turbulence is
also produced in the beam. These processes, plus particle isotropization, the
interaction scale, and light retardation effects, provide the necessary
ingredients for short-lived, bright coherent radiation bursts. The mechanism
studied in this work explains the general properties of FRB 121102, and may
also be applied to other repetitive FRBs. Coherent emission from electrons and
positrons accelerated in cavitons provides a plausible explanation of FRBs.

We propose to use degree-scale angular clustering of fast radio bursts (FRBs)
to identify their origin and the host galaxy population. We study the
information content in autocorrelation of the angular positions and dispersion
measures (DM) and in cross-correlation with galaxies. We show that the
cross-correlation with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies will place
stringent constraints on the mean physical quantities associated with FRBs. If
$\sim$10,000 FRBs are detected with $\lesssim \rm deg$ resolution in the SDSS
field, the clustering analysis with the intrinsic DM scatter of $100\, {\rm
pc}/{\rm cm}^3$ can constrain the global abundance of free electrons at $z\lt1$
and the large-scale bias of FRB host galaxies (the statistical relation between
the distribution of host galaxies and cosmic matter density field) with
fractional errors (with a $68\%$ confidence level) of $\sim10\%$ and
$\sim20\%$, respectively. The mean near-source dispersion measure and the delay
time distribution of FRB rates relative to the global star forming rate can be
also determined by combining the clustering and the probability distribution
function of DM. Our approach will be complementary to high-resolution ($\ll
{\rm deg}$) event localization using e.g., VLA and VLBI for identifying the
origin of FRBs and the source environment. We strongly encourage future
observational programs such as CHIME, UTMOST, and HIRAX to survey FRBs in the
SDSS field.

We present results from a new incoherent-beam Fast Radio Burst (FRB) search
on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Pathfinder. Its
large instantaneous field of view (FoV) and relative thermal insensitivity
allow us to probe the ultra-bright tail of the FRB distribution, and to test a
recent claim that this distribution's slope, $\alpha\equiv-\frac{\partial \log
N}{\partial \log S}$, is quite small. A 256-input incoherent beamformer was
deployed on the CHIME Pathfinder for this purpose. If the FRB distribution were
described by a single power-law with $\alpha=0.7$, we would expect an FRB
detection every few days, making this the fastest survey on sky at present. We
collected 1268 hours of data, amounting to one of the largest exposures of any
FRB survey, with over 2.4\,$\times$\,10$^5$\,deg$^2$\,hrs. Having seen no
bursts, we have constrained the rate of extremely bright events to
$<\!13$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ above $\sim$\,220$\sqrt{(\tau/\rm ms)}$ Jy\,ms
for $\tau$ between 1.3 and 100\,ms, at 400--800\,MHz. The non-detection also
allows us to rule out $\alpha\lesssim0.9$ with 95$\%$ confidence, after
marginalizing over uncertainties in the GBT rate at 700--900\,MHz, though we
show that for a cosmological population and a large dynamic range in flux
density, $\alpha$ is brightness-dependent. Since FRBs now extend to large
enough distances that non-Euclidean effects are significant, there is still
expected to be a dearth of faint events and relative excess of bright events.
Nevertheless we have constrained the allowed number of ultra-intense FRBs.
While this does not have significant implications for deeper, large-FoV surveys
like full CHIME and APERTIF, it does have important consequences for other
wide-field, small dish experiments.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have excessive dispersion measures (DMs) and an
all-sky distribution, which point toward an extragalactic or even a
cosmological origin. We develop a method to extract the mean host galaxy DM
($\left\langle{\rm DM_{HG,loc}}\right\rangle$) and the characterized luminosity
($L$) of FRBs using the observed DM-Flux data, based on the assumption of a
narrow luminosity distribution. Applying Bayesian inference to the data of 21
FRBs, we derive a relatively large mean host DM, i.e. $\left\langle{\rm
DM_{HG,loc}}\right\rangle \sim 270~\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ with a large dispersion. A
relatively large ${\rm DM_{HG}}$ of FRBs is also supported by the millisecond
scattering times of some FRBs and the relatively small redshift $z=0.19273$ of
FRB 121102 (which gives ${\rm DM_{HG,loc}} \sim 210 ~\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$). The
large host galaxy DM may be contributed by the ISM or a near-source plasma in
the host galaxy. If it is contributed by the ISM, the type of the FRB host
galaxies would not be Milky Way (MW)-like, consistent with the detected host of
FRB 121102. We also discuss the possibility of having a near-source supernova
remnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or HII region that gives a significant
contribution to the observed ${\rm DM_{HG}}$.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05482v3
The similarity of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 with those of long gamma-ray
bursts and Type I super-luminous supernovae suggests that this FRB could be
associated with a young magnetar. By assuming the FRB emission to be produced
within the magnetosphere, we derive a lower limit on the age of the magnetar,
after which GHz emission is able to escape freely from the dense relativistic
wind of the magnetar. Another lower limit is obtained by requiring the
dispersion measure contributed by the electron/positron pair wind to be
consistent with the observations of the host galaxy. Furthermore, we also
derive some upper limits on the magnetar age with discussions on possible
energy sources of the FRB emission and the recently-discovered persistent radio
counterpart. As a result, some constraints on model parameters are addressed by
reconciling the lower limits with the possible upper limits that are derived
with an assumption of rotational energy source.

Sub-arcsecond localization of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102
revealed its coincidence with a dwarf host galaxy and a steady (`quiescent')
non-thermal radio source. We show that the properties of the host galaxy are
consistent with those of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) and
hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were
previously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of
newly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation
periods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario
whereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar
remnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements
on the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta
(accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula),
energetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the
quiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century.
The quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the
shock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the
surrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar
wind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow
from an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be
too young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time
derivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent
radio source. We propose future tests of the SLSNe-I/LGRB/FRB connection, such
as searches for FRBs from nearby SLSNe-I/LGRB on timescales of decades after
their explosions.

We present the first interferometric detections of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs),
an enigmatic new class of astrophysical transient. In a 180-day survey of the
Southern sky we discovered 3 FRBs at 843 MHz with the UTMOST array, as part of
commissioning science during a major ongoing upgrade. The wide field of view of
UTMOST ($\approx 9$ deg$^{2}$) is well suited to FRB searches. The primary beam
is covered by 352 partially overlapping fan-beams, each of which is searched
for FRBs in real time with pulse widths in the range 0.655 to 42 ms, and
dispersion measures $\leq$2000 pc cm$^{-3}$. Detections of FRBs with the UTMOST
array places a lower limit on their distances of $\approx 10^4$ km (limit of
the telescope near-field) supporting the case for an astronomical origin.
Repeating FRBs at UTMOST or an FRB detected simultaneously with the Parkes
radio telescope and UTMOST, would allow a few arcsec localisation, thereby
providing an excellent means of identifying FRB host galaxies, if present. Up
to 100 hours of follow-up for each FRB has been carried out with the UTMOST,
with no repeating bursts seen. From the detected position, we present 3$\sigma$
error ellipses of 15 arcsec x 8.4 deg on the sky for the point of origin for
the FRBs. We estimate an all-sky FRB rate at 843 MHz above a fluence $\cal
F_\mathrm{lim}$ of 11 Jy ms of $\sim 78$ events sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at the 95
percent confidence level. The measured rate of FRBs at 843 MHz is of order two
times higher than we had expected, scaling from the FRB rate at the Parkes
radio telescope, assuming that FRBs have a flat spectral index and a uniform
distribution in Euclidean space. We examine how this can be explained by FRBs
having a steeper spectral index and/or a flatter log$N$-log$\mathcal{F}$
distribution than expected for a Euclidean Universe.

Recently a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 has been confirmed to be
an extragalactic event and a persistent radio counterpart has been identified.
While other possibilities are not ruled out, the emission properties are
broadly consistent with Murase et al. (2016) that theoretically proposed
quasi-steady radio emission as a counterpart of both FRBs and pulsar-driven
supernovae. Here we constrain the model parameters of such a young neutron star
scenario for FRB 121102. If the associated supernova has a conventional ejecta
mass of $M_{\rm ej}\gtrsim{\rm a \ few}\ M_\odot$, a neutron star with an age
of $t_{\rm age} \sim 10-100 \ \rm yrs$, an initial spin period of $P_{i}
\lesssim$ a few ms, and a dipole magnetic field of $B_{\rm dip} \lesssim {\rm a
\ few} \times 10^{13} \ \rm G$ can be compatible with the observations.
However, in this case, the magnetically-powered scenario may be favored as an
FRB energy source because of the efficiency problem in the rotation-powered
scenario. On the other hand, if the associated supernova is an ultra-stripped
one or the neutron star is born by the accretion-induced collapse with $M_{\rm
ej} \sim 0.1 \ M_\odot$, a younger neutron star with $t_{\rm age} \sim 1-10$
yrs can be the persistent radio source and might produce FRBs with the
spin-down power. These possibilities can be distinguished by the decline rate
of the quasi-steady radio counterpart.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04226v2
Are some neutron stars produced without a supernova, without ejecting mass in
a remnant? Theoretical calculations of core collapse in massive stars often
predict this. The observation of the repeating FRB 121102, whose dispersion
measure has not changed over several years, suggests that dark core collapses
are not just failures of computer codes, but may be real. The existence of one
repeating FRB with unchanging dispersion measure is not conclusive, but within
a decade hundreds or thousands of FRB are expected to be discovered, likely
including scores of repeaters, permitting useful statistical inferences. A
na\"{\i}ve supernova remnant model predicts observable decline in dispersion
measure for 100 years after its formation. If an upper limit on the decline of
2 pc/cm$^3$-y is set for five repeating FRB, then the na\"{\i}ve model with
nominal parameters is rejected at the 95\% level of confidence. This may
indicate dark neutron star formation without a supernova or supernova remnant.
This hypothesis may also be tested with LSST data that would show, if present,
a supernova at an interferometric FRB position if it occurred within the LSST
epoch.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05831v4
In this paper, we propose a new scenario in which a rapidly-rotating
strongly-magnetized pulsar without any surrounding supernova ejecta produces
fast radio bursts (FRBs) repeatedly via some mechanisms, and meanwhile, an
ultra-relativistic electron/positron pair wind from the pulsar sweeps up its
ambient dense interstellar medium, giving rise to a non-relativistic pulsar
wind nebula (PWN). We show that the synchrotron radio emission from such a PWN
is bright enough to account for the recently-discovered persistent radio source
associated with the repeating FRB 121102 in reasonable ranges of the model
parameters. In addition, our PWN scenario is consistent with the non-evolution
of the dispersion measure inferred from all the repeating bursts observed in
four years.

Plasma lenses in the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can strongly
modulate FRB amplitudes for a wide range of distances, including the $\sim $
Gpc distance of the repeater FRB121102. To produce caustics, the lens'
dispersion-measure depth (${\rm DM}_{\ell}$), scale size ($a$), and distance
from the source ($d_{\rm sl}$) must satisfy ${\rm DM}_{\ell} d_{\rm sl} / a^2
\gtrsim 0.65~ {\rm pc^2 \ AU^{-2} \ cm^{-3}}$. Caustics produce strong
magnifications ($\lesssim 10^2$) on short time scales ($\sim$ hours to days and
perhaps shorter) along with narrow, epoch dependent spectral peaks (0.1 to
1~GHz). However, strong suppression also occurs in long-duration ($\sim$
months) troughs. For geometries that produce multiple images, the resulting
burst components will arrive differentially by $< 1~\mu$s to tens of ms and
they will show different apparent dispersion measures, $\delta{\rm DM}_{\rm
apparent} \sim 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Arrival time perturbations may mask any
underlying periodicity with period $\lesssim 1$ s. When arrival times differ by
less than the burst width, interference effects in dynamic spectra are
expected. Strong lensing requires source sizes smaller than $({\rm
Fresnel~scale)^2} / a$, which can be satisfied by compact objects such as
neutron star magnetospheres but not by AGNs. Much of the phenomenology of the
repeating fast radio burst source FRB121102 is similar to lensing effects. The
overall picture can be tested by obtaining wideband spectra of bursts (from
$<1$ to 10 GHz and possibly higher), which can also be used to characterize the
plasma environment near FRB sources. A rich variety of phenomena is expected
from an ensemble of lenses near the FRB source. We discuss constraints on
densities, magnetic fields, and locations of plasma lenses related to
requirements for lensing to occur.

We use the observed properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and a number of
general physical considerations to provide a broad-brush model for the physical
properties of FRB sources and the radiation mechanism. We show that the
magnetic field in the source region should be at least 10^{14} Gauss. This
strong field is required to ensure that the electrons have sufficiently high
ground state Landau energy so that particle collisions, instabilities, and
strong electric and magnetic fields associated with the FRB radiation do not
perturb electrons' motion in the direction transverse to the magnetic field and
destroy their coherent motion; coherence is required by the high observed
brightness temperature of FRB radiation. The electric field in the source
region required to sustain particle motion for a wave period is estimated to be
of order 10^{11} esu. These requirements suggest that FRBs are produced near
the surface of magnetars perhaps via forced reconnection of magnetic fields to
produce episodic, repeated, outbursts. The beaming-corrected energy release in
these bursts is estimated to be ~10^{36} ergs, whereas the total energy in the
magnetic field is at least ~10^{45} ergs. We provide a number of predictions
for this model which can be tested by future observations. One of which is that
short duration FRB-like bursts should exist at much higher frequencies,
possibly up to optical.

One of the goals of 5G wireless systems stated by the NGMN alliance is to
provide moderate rates (50+ Mbps) everywhere and with very high reliability. We
term this service Ultra-Reliable Ubiquitous-Rate Communication (UR2C). This
paper investigates the role of frequency reuse in supporting UR2C in the
downlink. To this end, two frequency reuse schemes are considered:
user-specific frequency reuse (FRu) and BS-specific frequency reuse (FRb). For
a given unit frequency channel, FRu reduces the number of serving user
equipments (UEs), whereas FRb directly decreases the number of interfering base
stations (BSs). This increases the distance from the interfering BSs and the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) attains ultra-reliability, e.g. 99% SIR
coverage at a randomly picked UE. The ultra-reliability is, however, achieved
at the cost of the reduced frequency allocation, which may degrade overall
downlink rate. To fairly capture this reliability-rate tradeoff, we propose
ubiquitous rate defined as the maximum downlink rate whose required SIR can be
achieved with ultra-reliability. By using stochastic geometry, we derive
closed-form ubiquitous rate as well as the optimal frequency reuse rules for
UR2C.

The photon mass, $m_\gamma$, can in principle be constrained using
measurements of the dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs), once
the FRB redshifts are known. The DM of the repeating FRB 121102 is known to $<
1$\%, a host galaxy has now been identified with high confidence,and its
redshift, $z$, has now been determined with high accuracy: $z = 0.19273(8)$.
Taking into account the plasma contributions to the DM from the Intergalactic
medium (IGM) and the Milky Way, we use the data on FRB 121102 to derive the
constraint $m_\gamma \lesssim 2.2 \times 10^{-14}$ eV c$^{-2}$ ($3.9 \times
10^{-50}$ kg). Since the plasma and photon mass contributions to DMs have
different redshift dependences, they could in principle be distinguished by
measurements of more FRB redshifts, enabling the sensitivity to $m_\gamma$ to
be improved.

The fast radio bursts (FRBs) 110220 and 140514 were detected at telescope
pointing locations within 9 arcmin of each other over three years apart, both
within the same 14.4 arcmin beam of the Parkes radio telescope. Nevertheless,
they generally have not been considered to be from the same source because of a
vastly different dispersion measure (DM) for the two bursts by over $380\,{\rm
pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Here we consider the hypothesis that these two FRBs are from the
same neutron star embedded within a supernova remnant (SNR) that provides an
evolving DM as the ejecta expands and becomes more diffuse. Using such a model
and the observed DM change, it can be argued that the corresponding SN must
have occurred within $\approx10.2$ years of FRB 110220. Furthermore,
constraints can be placed on the SN ejecta mass and explosion energy, which
appear to require a stripped envelope (Type Ib/c) SN and/or a very energetic
explosion. A third FRB from this location would be even more constraining,
allowing the component of the DM due to the SNR to be separated from the
unchanging DM components due to the host galaxy and intergalactic medium. In
the future, if more FRBs are found to repeat, the sort of arguments presented
here can be used to test the young neutron star progenitor hypothesis for FRBs.

There are striking phenomenological similarities between Fast Radio Bursts
and lightning in the Earth's and planetary atmospheres. Both have very low duty
factors, $\lesssim 10^{-8}$--$10^{-5}$ for FRB and (very roughly) $\sim
10^{-4}$ for the main return strokes in an active thundercloud. Lightning
occurs in an electrified insulating atmosphere when a conducting path is
created by and permits current flow. FRB may occur in neutron star
magnetospheres whose plasma is believed to be divided by vacuum gaps. Vacuum is
a perfect insulator unless electric fields are sufficient for electron-positron
pair production by curvature radiation, a high-energy analogue of electrostatic
breakdown in an insulating gas. FRB may be "electrars" powered by the release
of stored electrostatic energy, counterparts to Soft Gamma Repeaters powered by
the release of stored magnetostatic energy (magnetars). This frees pulsar FRB
models from the constraint that their power not exceed the instantaneous
spin-down power. Energetic constraints imply that the sources of more energetic
FRB have shorter spin-down lifetimes, perhaps shorter than the three years over
which FRB 121102 has been observed to repeat.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00627v1
We developed a generic formalism to estimate the event rate and the redshift
distribution of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in our previous publication (Bera et
al. 2016), considering FRBs are of an extragalactic origin. In this paper we
present (a) the predicted pulse widths of FRBs by considering two different
scattering models, (b) the minimum total energy required to detect events, (c)
the redshift distribution and (d) the detection rates of FRBs for the Ooty Wide
Field Array (OWFA). The energy spectrum of FRBs is modelled as a power law with
an exponent $-\alpha$ and our analysis spans a range $-3\leq \alpha \leq 5$. We
find that OWFA will be capable of detecting FRBs with $\alpha\geq 0$. The
redshift distribution and the event rates of FRBs are estimated by assuming two
different energy distribution functions; a Delta function and a Schechter
luminosity function with an exponent $-2\le \gamma \le 2$. We consider an
empirical scattering model based on pulsar observations (model I) as well as a
theoretical model (model II) expected for the intergalactic medium. The
redshift distributions peak at a particular redshift $z_p$ for a fixed value of
$\alpha$, which lie in the range $0.3\leq z_p \leq 1$ for the scattering model
I and remain flat and extend up to high redshifts ($z\lesssim 5$) for the
scattering model II.

We examine the possibility that Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) originate from the
activity of extragalactic civilizations. Our analysis shows that beams used for
powering large light sails could yield parameters that are consistent with
FRBs. The characteristic diameter of the beam emitter is estimated through a
combination of energetic and engineering constraints, and both approaches
intriguingly yield a similar result which is on the scale of a large rocky
planet. Moreover, the optimal frequency for powering the light sail is shown to
be similar to the detected FRB frequencies. These `coincidences' lend some
credence to the possibility that FRBs might be artificial in origin. Other
relevant quantities, such as the characteristic mass of the light sail, and the
angular velocity of the beam, are also derived. By using the FRB occurrence
rate, we infer upper bounds on the rate of FRBs from extragalactic
civilizations in a typical galaxy. The possibility of detecting fainter signals
is briefly discussed, and the wait time for an exceptionally bright FRB event
in the Milky Way is estimated.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio signals occurring at
cosmological distances. However the physical model of FRBs is mystery, many
models have been proposed. Here we study the frequency distributions of peak
flux, fluence, duration and waiting time for the repeating FRB 121102. The
cumulative distributions of peak flux, fluence and duration show power-law
forms. The waiting time distribution also shows power-law distribution, and is
consistent with a non-stationary Poisson process. These distributions are
similar as those of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). We also use the statistical
results to test the proposed models for FRBs. These distributions are
consistent with the predictions from avalanche models of slowly driven
nonlinear dissipative systems.

We have developed FFT beamforming techniques for the CHIME radio telescope,
to search for and localize the astrophysical signals from Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs) over a large instantaneous field-of-view (FOV) while maintaining the
full angular resolution of CHIME. We implement a hybrid beamforming pipeline in
a GPU correlator, synthesizing 256 FFT-formed beams in the North-South
direction by four formed beams along East-West via exact phasing, tiling a sky
area of ~250 square degrees. A zero-padding approximation is employed to
improve chromatic beam alignment across the wide bandwidth of 400 to 800 MHz.
We up-channelize the data in order to achieve fine spectral resolution of
$\Delta\nu$=24 kHz and time cadence of 0.983 ms, desirable for detecting
transient and dispersed signals such as those from FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01475v3
If fast radio bursts (FRBs) originate from galaxies at cosmological
distances, then their all-sky rate implies that the Milky Way may host an FRB
on average once every 30-1500 years. If FRBs repeat for decades or centuies, a
local FRB could be active now. A typical Galactic FRB would produce a
millisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the
radio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell
phones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global
array of low-cost radio receivers. One possibility is to use the ~1GHz
communication channel in cellular phones through a Citizens-Science
downloadable application. Participating phones would continuously listen for
and record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a
central data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all
participants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from
an astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times
reported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,
potentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating
at diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield
the dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within
the Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz
FM-radio receivers present in cell phones for an FRB search at lower
frequencies. Alternatively, numerous "software-defined radio" (SDR) devices,
costing ~$10 US each, could be plugged into USB ports of personal computers
around the world (particularly in radio quiet regions) to establish the global
network of receivers.

The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned array of
~200 000 radio antennas deployed over ~200 000 km2 in a mountainous site. It
aims primarly at detecting high-energy neutrinos via the observation of
extensive air showers induced by the decay in the atmosphere of taus produced
by the interaction of cosmic neutrinos under the Earth surface. GRAND aims at
reaching a neutrino sensitivity of 5.10$^{11}$ E$^{-2}$
GeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$ above 3.10$^{16}$ eV. This ensures the
detection of cosmogenic neutrinos in the most pessimistic source models, and
~50 events per year are expected for the standard models. The instrument will
also detect UHECRs and possibly FRBs. Here we show how our preliminary design
should enable us to reach our sensitivity goals, and discuss the steps to be
taken to achieve GRAND.

We propose the model describing the observed multiple fast radio bursts due
to the close encounters and collisions of neutron stars in the central clusters
of the evolved galactic nuclei. The subsystem of neutron star cluster may
originate in the dense galactic nucleus evolutionary in the combined processes
of stellar and dynamical evolution. The neutron stars in the compact cluster
can produce the short living binaries with the highly eccentric orbits, and
finally collide after several orbital revolutions. Fast radio bursts may be
produced during the close periastron approach and at the process of the final
binary merging. In the sufficiently dense star cluster the neutron stars
collisions can be very frequent. Therefore, this model can explain in principle
the observed recurrent (multiple) fast radio bursts, analogous to the observed
ones from the source FRB 121102. Among the possible observational signatures of
the proposed model may be the registration of the gravitational wave bursts by
the laser interferometers LIGO/VIRGO or by the next generation of gravitational
wave detectors.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04094v2
Recent observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate a perplexing,
inconsistent picture. We propose a unified scenario to interpret diverse FRBs
observed. A regular pulsar, otherwise unnoticeable at a cosmological distance,
may produce a bright FRB if its magnetosphere is suddenly "combed" by a nearby,
strong plasma stream towards the anti-stream direction. If the Earth is to the
night side of the stream, the combed magnetic sheath would sweep across the
direction of Earth and make a detectable FRB. The stream could be an AGN flare,
a GRB or supernova blastwave, a tidal disruption event, or even a stellar
flare. Since it is the energy {\em flux} received by the pulsar rather than the
luminosity of the stream origin that defines the properties of the FRB, this
model predicts a variety of counterparts of FRBs, including a possible
connection between FRB 150418 and an AGN flare, a possible connection between
FRB 131104 and a weak GRB, a steady radio nebula associated with the repeating
FRB 121102, and probably no bright counterparts for some FRBs.

We consider some general implications of bright gamma-ray counterparts to
fast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that even if these manifest in only a
fraction of FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including
Swift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the
energy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a
magnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the
intergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the
required gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or
extended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with
the rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios,
the prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to
escape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a
wind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB
emission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio
afterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated.
Gravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests.

Tenuous wind bubbles, which are formed by the spin-down activity of central
compact remnants, are relevant in some models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and
super-luminous supernovae. We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on
the role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating
neutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular
properties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and
radio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of
>10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio
emission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be
detected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible
counterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of
bursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead
to a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the
shocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the
nebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to
short-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.
Possible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.
(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to
afterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario,
this burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc)
high-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the
subsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA. (iv)
Finally, we discuss several implications specific to FRBs, including
constraints on the emission regions and limits on soft gamma-ray counterparts.

Modern radio telescopes are favouring densely packed array layouts with large
numbers of antennas ($N_\textrm{A}\gtrsim 1000$). Since the complexity of
traditional correlators scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_\textrm{A}^2)$, there will be
a steep cost for realizing the full imaging potential of these powerful
instruments. Through our generic and efficient E-field Parallel Imaging
Correlator (EPIC), we present the first software demonstration of a generalized
direct imaging algorithm, namely, the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF)
imager. Not only does it bring down the cost for dense layouts to
$\mathcal{O}(N_\textrm{A}\log_2 N_\textrm{A})$ but can also image from
irregular layouts and heterogeneous arrays of antennas. EPIC is highly modular,
parallelizable, implemented in object-oriented Python, and publicly available.
We have verified the images produced to be equivalent to those from traditional
techniques to within a precision set by gridding coarseness. We have also
validated our implementation on data observed with the Long Wavelength Array
(LWA1). We provide a detailed framework for imaging with heterogeneous arrays
and show that EPIC robustly estimates the input sky model for such arrays.
Antenna layouts with dense filling factors consisting of a large number of
antennas such as LWA, the Square Kilometre Array, Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array, and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment will
gain significant computational advantage by deploying an optimized version of
EPIC. The algorithm is a strong candidate for instruments targeting transient
searches of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) as well as planetary and exoplanetary
phenomena due to the availability of high-speed calibrated time-domain images
and low output bandwidth relative to visibility-based systems.

Radio astronomy has traditionally depended on observatories allocating time
to observers for exclusive use of their telescopes. The disadvantage of this
scheme is that the data thus collected is rarely used for other astronomy
applications, and in many cases, is unsuitable. For example, properly
calibrated pulsar search data can, with some reduction, be used for spectral
line surveys. A backend that supports plugging in multiple applications to a
telescope to perform commensal data analysis will vastly increase the science
throughput of the facility. In this paper, we present 'SETIBURST', a robotic,
commensal, realtime multi-science backend for the 305-m Arecibo Telescope. The
system uses the 1.4 GHz, seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver
whenever it is operated. SETIBURST currently supports two applications:
SERENDIP VI, a SETI spectrometer that is conducting a search for signs of
technological life, and ALFABURST, a fast transient search system that is
conducting a survey of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Based on the FRB event rate
and the expected usage of ALFA, we expect 0-5 FRB detections over the coming
year. SETIBURST also provides the option of plugging in more applications. We
outline the motivation for our instrumentation scheme and the scientific
motivation of the two surveys, along with their descriptions and related
discussions.

We argue that the localization of the Repeating FRB at $\sim 1$ Gpc excludes
rotationally-powered type of radio emission (e.g., analogues of Crab's giant
pulses coming from very young energetic pulsars) as the origin of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01100v2
The precise localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB 121102) has
provided the first unambiguous association (chance coincidence probability
$p\lesssim3\times10^{-4}$) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio
counterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart
and find that it is an extended ($0.6^{\prime\prime}-0.8^{\prime\prime}$)
object displaying prominent Balmer and [OIII] emission lines. Based on the
spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a
low-metallicity, star-forming, $m_{r^\prime} = 25.1$ AB mag dwarf galaxy at a
redshift of $z=0.19273(8)$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc.
From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host
galaxy to have a diameter $\lesssim4$ kpc and a stellar mass of
$M_*\sim4-7\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to
3$\,M_\odot\,L_\odot^{-1}$. Based on the H$\alpha$ flux, we estimate the star
formation rate of the host to be $0.4\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and a
substantial host dispersion measure depth $\lesssim 324\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$.
The net dispersion measure contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is
likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show
that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102's location reported by Marcote
et al (2017) is offset from the galaxy's center of light by $\sim$200 mas and
the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB
121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric
localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities
and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long
gamma ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.

The canonical pulsar magnetosphere contains a bubble of closed magnetic field
lines that is separated from the open lines by current sheets, and different
branches of such sheets intersect at a critical line on the light cylinder
(LC). The LC is located far away from the neutron star, and the pulsar's
intrinsic magnetic field at that location is much weaker than the commonly
quoted numbers applicable to the star surface. The magnetic field surrounding
supermassive black holes that reside in galactic nuclei is of comparable or
greater strength. Therefore, when the pulsar travels inside such regions, a
non-negligible Lorentz force is experienced by the current sheets, which tends
to pull them apart at the critical line. As breakage occurs, instabilities
ensue that burst the bubble, allowing closed field lines to snap open and
release large amounts of electromagnetic energy, sufficient to power fast radio
bursts (FRBs). This process is necessarily associated with an environment of a
strong magnetic field and thus might explain the large rotation measures
recorded for the FRBs. We sketch a portrait of the process and examine its
compatibility with several other salient features of the FRBs.

The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond
localization (~ 100mas precision) of FRB121102 using the VLA has led to its
unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to
the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise
localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship
between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent
emission. Here we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations
using the European VLBI Network and the 305-m Arecibo telescope, which
simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at
milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a
projected linear separation of < 40pc (< 12mas angular separation, at 95%
confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and
persistent radio source (~ 2-4mas at 1.7GHz), which are both similar to the
expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a
projected size constrained to be < 0.7pc (< 0.2mas angular extent at 5.0GHz)
and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of T_b > 5 x 10^7K. Together,
these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between
FRB121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source
associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron
star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB121102 that
best match the observed data.

Fast radio bursts are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature
with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an
extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger
than any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs
have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute
localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host
galaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the
presence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted
in an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here
we report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known
repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric
observations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise
localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180
uJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with
non-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The
flux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day
timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size
less than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst
having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent
star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of
extragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly
faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct
sub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable
associations.

A $\gamma$-ray transient, Swift J0644.5-5111, has been claimed to be
associated with FRB 131104. The $\gamma$-ray energy output is estimated as
$E_\gamma \approx 5\times 10^{51}$\,erg at the nominal $z\approx 0.55$ redshift
implied by the dispersion measure of FRB 131104. However, a long-term radio
imaging follow-up observations only place an upper limit on the radio afterglow
flux of Swift J0644.5-5111. Applying the external shock model, we make a
detailed constraint on the afterglow parameters for the FRB 131104/Swift
J0644.5-5111 system. We find that for the commonly used microphysics shock
parameters (e.g., $\epsilon_e=0.1$, $\epsilon_B=0.01$ and $p=2.3$), if the
redshift value inferred from the DM value is correct to order of magnitude
(i.e., $z>0.1$), the ambient medium number density should be $\leq
10^{-3}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$, which is the typical value for a compact binary merger
environment but disfavors a massive star origin. Assuming a typical ISM
density, one would require that the redshift of the FRB much smaller than the
value inferred from DM value ($z\ll0.1$), implying a non-cosmological origin of
DM. The constraints are much looser if one adopts smaller $\epsilon_B$ and
$\epsilon_e$ values, as observed in some GRB afterglows. The FRB 131104/Swift
J0644.5-5111 association remains plausible. We critically discuss possible
progenitor models for the system.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09517v2
Recently, DeLaunay et al. (2016) discovered a gamma-ray transient, Swift
J0644.5-5111, associated with the fast radio burst (FRB) 131104. They also
reported follow-up broadband observations beginning two days after the FRB and
provided upper limits on a putative afterglow of this transient. In this paper,
we show that if such a transient drives a relativistic shock as in a
cosmological gamma-ray burst (GRB), these upper limits are consistent with an
environment of which density is much less than that of an interstellar medium
but typical for the outskirts' density of a galaxy when the typical values of
three microphysical parameters of the shock are taken. This appears to be
inconsistent with the catastrophic event models in which the central engine of
Swift J0644.5-5111 is surrounded by an interstellar medium, but together with
the properties of the gamma-ray transient, favors the binary neutron star
merger origin. We further constrain the physical parameters of the postmerger
object by assuming that Swift J0644.5-5111 results from internal dissipation of
a spinning-down pulsar wind, and we find that the postmerger object is an
ultra-strongly magnetized, very rapidly rotating pulsar. This merger event
should have given birth to a gravitational wave burst, an FRB, and a short GRB
or an extended X-ray/gamma-ray emission if a relativistic jet of the GRB is
missed. Such "triplets" would be testable in the near future with the advanced
LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories.

Statistical interpretation of sparsely sampled event rates has become vital
for new transient surveys, particularly those aimed at detecting fast radio
bursts (FRBs). We provide an accessible reference for a number of simple, but
critical, statistical questions relevant for current transient and FRB research
and utilizing the negative binomial model for counts in which the count rate
parameter is uncertain or randomly biased from one study to the next. We apply
these methods to re-assess and update results from previous FRB surveys,
finding as follows. 1) Thirteen FRBs detected across five
high-Galactic-latitude (> 30$^\circ$) surveys are highly significant $(p =
5\times 10^{-5})$ evidence of a higher rate relative to the single FRB detected
across four low-latitude (< 5$^\circ$) surveys, even after accounting for
effects that dampen Galactic plane sensitivity. High- vs. mid-latitude (5 to
15$^\circ$) is marginally significant $(p = 0.03)$. 2) A meta analysis of
twelve heterogeneous surveys gives an FRB rate of 2866 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$
above 1 Jy at high Galactic latitude (95% confidence 1121 to 7328) and 285
sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at low/mid latitudes (95% from 48 to 1701). 3) Using the
Parkes HTRU high-latitude setup requires 193 observing hours to achieve 50%
probability of detecting an FRB and 937 hours to achieve 95% probability, based
on the ten detections of (Champion et al. 2016) and appropriately accounting
for uncertainty in the unknown Poisson rate. 4) Two quick detections at Parkes
from a small number of high-latitude fields (Ravi et al. 2015; Petroff et al.
2015) tentatively favor a look long survey style relative to the scan wide HTRU
survey, but only at $p = 0.07$ significance.

The detection of non-repeating events in the radio spectrum has become an
important area of study in radio astronomy over the last decade due to the
discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We have implemented a single pulse
detection algorithm, for NVIDIA GPUs, which use boxcar filters of varying
widths. Our code performs the calculation of standard deviation, matched
filtering by using boxcar filters and thresholding based on the signal-to-noise
ratio. We present our parallel implementation of our single pulse detection
algorithm. Our GPU algorithm is approximately 17x faster than our current CPU
OpenMP code (NVIDIA Titan XP vs Intel E5-2650v3). This code is part of the
AstroAccelerate project which is a many-core accelerated time-domain signal
processing code for radio astronomy. This work allows our AstroAccelerate code
to perform a single pulse search on SKA-like data 4.3x faster than real-time.

Aims: Following the detection of the fast radio burst FRB150418 by the SUPERB
project at the Parkes radio telescope, we aim to search for very-high energy
gamma-ray afterglow emission. Methods: Follow-up observations in the very-high
energy gamma-ray domain were obtained with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescope system within 14.5 hours of the radio burst. Results: The
obtained 1.4 hours of gamma-ray observations are presented and discussed. At
the 99 % C.L. we obtained an integral upper limit on the gamma-ray flux of
(E>350 GeV) < 1.33 x 10^-8 m^-2s^-1. Differential flux upper limits as function
of the photon energy were derived and used to constrain the intrinsic
high-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418. Conclusions: No hints for
high-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418 were found. Taking absorption on
the extragalactic background light into account and assuming a distance of z =
0.492 based on radio and optical counterpart studies and consistent with the
FRB dispersion, we constrain the gamma-ray luminosity at 1 TeV to L < 5.1 x
10^47 erg/s at 99% C.L.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate
beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and
their propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as
cosmological probes. We report on a mildly dispersed (dispersion measure
266.5+-0.1 pc cm^-3), exceptionally intense (120+-30 Jy), linearly polarized,
scintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 arcmin^2. Based
on a low Faraday rotation (12.0+-0.7 rad m^-2), we infer negligible
magnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of
the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nG, parallel to the line-of-sight.
The burst scintillation suggests weak turbulence in the ionized intergalactic
medium.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05580v1
The localization of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been hindered by the poor
angular resolution of the detection observations and inconclusive
identification of transient or variable counterparts. Recently a $\gamma$-ray
pulse of $380$ s duration has been associated with the fast radio burst FRB
131104. We report on radio-continuum imaging observations of the original
localization region of the FRB, beginning three days after the event and
comprising 25 epochs over 2.5 yr. Besides probabilistic arguments that suggest
that the association between the $\gamma$-ray transient and the FRB is not
compelling, we provide upper limits on a putative radio afterglow of this
transient that are at odds with standard models for its progenitor. We further
report the discovery of an unusual variable radio source spatially and
temporally coincident with FRB 131104, but not spatially coincident with the
$\gamma$-ray event. The radio variable flares by a factor of $3$ above its long
term average within $10$ d of the FRB at 7.5 GHz, with a factor-of-$2$ increase
at $5.5$ GHz. Within our observations, the variable has persisted with only
modest modulation and never approached the flux density observed in the days
after the FRB. We identify an optical counterpart to the variable. Optical and
infrared photometry, and deep optical spectroscopy, suggest that the object is
a narrow-line radio AGN.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03139v1
We report our discovery in Swift satellite data of a transient gamma-ray
counterpart (3.2$\sigma$ confidence) to the fast radio burst FRB131104, the
first such counterpart to any FRB. The transient has duration $T_{90} \gtrsim
100$s and fluence $S_\gamma\approx 4\times 10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, increasing
the energy budget for this event by more than a billion times; at the nominal
$z\approx 0.55$ redshift implied by its dispersion measure, the burst's
gamma-ray energy output is $E_\gamma \approx 5\times 10^{51}$ erg. The observed
radio to gamma-ray fluence ratio for FRB131104 is consistent with a lower limit
we derive from Swift observations of another FRB, which is not detected in
gamma-rays, and with an upper limit previously derived for the brightest
gamma-ray flare from SGR 1806-20, which was not detected in the radio. X-ray,
ultraviolet, and optical observations beginning two days after the FRB do not
reveal any associated afterglow, supernova, or transient; Swift observations
exclude association with the brightest 65% of Swift gamma-ray burst X-ray
afterglows, while leaving the possibility of an associated supernova at much
more than 10% the FRB's nominal distance, $D\gtrsim 320$ Mpc, largely
unconstrained. Transient high-luminosity gamma-ray emission arises most
naturally in a relativistic outflow or shock breakout, as for example from
magnetar flares, gamma-ray bursts, relativistic supernovae, and some types of
galactic nuclear activity. Our discovery thus bolsters the case for an
extragalactic origin for some FRBs and suggests that future rapid-response
observations might identify long-lived counterparts, resolving the nature of
these mysterious phenomena and realizing their promise as probes of cosmology
and fundamental physics.

We propose a new method to probe the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM)
beyond the virial radius (R_200) of a cluster of galaxies, where X-ray
observations are not easily achievable. In this method, we use dispersion
measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) that appear behind the cluster and
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect towards the cluster. The DMs reflect the
density of the intracluster medium (ICM) including the WHIM. If we observe a
sufficient number of FRBs in the direction of the cluster, we can derive the
density profile from the DMs. Similarly, we can derive the pressure profile
from the SZ effect. By combining the density and the pressure profiles, the
temperature profile can be obtained. Based on mock observations of nearby
clusters, we find that the density of the WHIM can be determined even at > 2
R_200 from the cluster center when FRB observations with the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA) become available. The temperature can be derived out to r~ 1.5
R_200, and the radius is limited by the current sensitivity of SZ observations.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed, sporadic radio pulses that are
likely extragalactic in nature. Here we investigate the constraints on the
source population from surveys carried out at frequencies $<1$~GHz. All but one
FRB has so far been discovered in the 1--2~GHz band, but new and emerging
instruments look set to become valuable probes of the FRB population at sub-GHz
frequencies in the near future. In this paper, we consider the impacts of
free-free absorption and multi-path scattering in our analysis via a number of
different assumptions about the intervening medium. We consider previous low
frequency surveys alongwith an ongoing survey with the University of Technology
digital backend for the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) as
well as future observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) and the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-Time Analysis Experiment
(HIRAX). We predict that CHIME and HIRAX will be able to observe $\sim$ 30 or
more FRBs per day, even in the most extreme scenarios where free-free
absorption and scattering can significantly impact the fluxes below 1~GHz. We
also show that UTMOST will detect 1--2 FRBs per month of observations. For
CHIME and HIRAX, the detection rates also depend greatly on the assumed FRB
distance scale. Some of the models we investigated predict an increase in the
FRB flux as a function of redshift at low frequencies. If FRBs are truly
cosmological sources, this effect may impact future surveys in this band,
particularly if the FRB population traces the cosmic star formation rate.

It is generally assumed that the sources of Fast Radio Bursts radiate roughly
isotropically, so that the observed low duty cycle of any individual source
indicates a similar low duty cycle of its radio-frequency emission. An
alternative hypothesis is that the radiative duty cycle is ${\cal O}(1)$, but
that the radiation is emitted in a beam with a solid angle comparable to the
observed duty cycle, whose direction wanders or sweeps across the sky. This
hypothesis relaxes the extreme power demands of isotropically radiating models
of FRB at the price of multiplying the number of sources. The constraints on
pulsar models are relaxed; rather than being unprecedentedly fast-spinning and
highly-magnetized with short spin-down times, their parameters may be closer to
those of typical radio pulsars. The nanoshots of Galactic pulsars pose
analogous energetic problems that may be resolved if their emission also is
beamed, suggesting a relation between these phenomena, despite their vastly
different energy scales.

We present a new model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy,
the Magellanic Clouds and the intergalactic medium (IGM) that can be used to
estimate distances to real or simulated pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs)
based on their dispersion measure (DM). The Galactic model has an extended
thick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk
representing the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to
Galactic HII regions, a Galactic Center disk and seven local features including
the Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from
the Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the
model. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189
pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used
for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the
uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and
within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that
95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less
than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the
TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all
measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are
estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and
FRBs.

This paper presents the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) for modeling
the rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and other infrequently observed
astronomical events. The NHPP, well-known in statistics, can model changes in
the rate as a function of both astronomical features and the details of an
observing campaign. This is particularly helpful for rare events like FRBs
because the NHPP can combine information across surveys, making the most of all
available information. The goal of the paper is two-fold. First, it is intended
to be a tutorial on the use of the NHPP. Second, we build an NHPP model that
incorporates beam patterns and a power law flux distribution for the rate of
FRBs. Using information from 12 surveys including 15 detections, we find an
all-sky FRB rate of 586.88 events per sky per day above a flux of 1 Jy (95\%
CI: 271.86, 923.72) and a flux power-law index of 0.91 (95\% CI: 0.57, 1.25).
Our rate is lower than other published rates, but consistent with the rate
given in Champion et al. 2016.

The dispersion measure of extragalactic radio transients, such as of recently
discovered Fast Radio Burst FRB150418, can be used to measure the column
density of free electrons in the intergalactic medium. The same electrons also
scatter the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, affecting precision
measurements of cosmological parameters. We explore the connection between the
dispersion measure of radio transients existing during the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR) and the total optical depth for the CMB, $\tau_{CMB}$,
showing that the existence of such transients would provide a new sensitive
probe of $\tau_{CMB}$. As an example, we consider the population of FRBs.
Assuming they exist during the EoR, we show that: (i) such sources can probe
the reionization history by measuring $\tau_{CMB}$ to sub-percent accuracy, and
(ii) they can be detected with high significance by an instrument such as the
Square Kilometer Array.

We present observations made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA), the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and the Giant Metre-Wave Telescope
of the radio source within the galaxy WISE~J071634.59-190039.2, claimed to be
host of FRB~150418 by Keane et al. (2016). We have established a common flux
density scale between the ATCA and JVLA observations, the main result of which
is to increase the flux densities obtained by Keane et al. At a frequency of
5.5 GHz, the source has a mean flux density of 140uJy and is variable on short
timescales with a modulation index of 0.36. Statistical analysis of the flux
densities shows that the variations seen are consistent with refractive
interstellar scintillation of the weak active galactic nucleus at the centre of
the galaxy. It may therefore be the case that the FRB and the galaxy are not
associated. However, taking into account the rarity of highly variable sources
in the radio sky, and our lack of knowledge of the progenitors of FRBs as a
class, the association between WISE~J071634.59-190039.2 and FRB~150418 remains
a possibility.

Our understanding of the universe relies mostly on electromagnetism. As
photons are the messengers, fundamental physics is concerned in testing their
properties. Photon mass upper limits have been earlier set through pulsar
observations, but new investigations are offered by the excess of dispersion
measure (DM) sometimes observed with pulsar and magnetar data at low
frequencies, or with the fast radio bursts (FRBs), of yet unknown origin.
Arguments for the excess of DM do not reach a consensus, but are not mutually
exclusive. Thus, we remind that for massive electromagnetism, dispersion goes
as the inverse of the frequency squared. Thereby, new avenues are offered also
by the recently operating ground observatories in 10-80 MHz domain and by the
proposed Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio astronomy (OLFAR). The
latter acts as a large aperture dish by employing a swarm of nano-satellites
observing the sky for the first time in the 0.1 - 15 MHz spectrum. The swarm
must be deployed sufficiently away from the ionosphere to avoid distortions
especially during the solar maxima, terrestrial interference and offer stable
conditions for calibration during observations.

We report on radio and X-ray observations of the only known repeating Fast
Radio Burst (FRB) source, FRB 121102. We have detected six additional radio
bursts from this source: five with the Green Bank Telescope at 2 GHz, and one
at 1.4 GHz at the Arecibo Observatory for a total of 17 bursts from this
source. All have dispersion measures consistent with a single value ($\sim559$
pc cm$^{-3}$) that is three times the predicted maximum Galactic value. The
2-GHz bursts have highly variable spectra like those at 1.4 GHz, indicating
that the frequency structure seen across the individual 1.4 and 2-GHz
bandpasses is part of a wideband process. X-ray observations of the FRB 121102
field with the Swift and Chandra observatories show at least one possible
counterpart; however, the probability of chance superposition is high. A radio
imaging observation of the field with the Jansky Very Large Array at 1.6 GHz
yields a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.3 mJy on any point-source continuum
emission. This upper limit, combined with archival WISE 22-$\mu$m and IPHAS
H$\alpha$ surveys, rules out the presence of an intervening Galactic HII
region. We update our estimate of the FRB detection rate in the PALFA survey to
be 1.1$^{+3.7}_{-1.0} \times 10^4$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ (95% confidence)
for peak flux density at 1.4 GHz above 300 mJy. We find that the intrinsic
widths of the 12 FRB 121102 bursts from Arecibo are, on average, significantly
longer than the intrinsic widths of the 13 single-component FRBs detected with
the Parkes telescope.

A conservative constraint on the rest mass of the photon can be estimated
under the assumption that the frequency dependence of dispersion from
astronomical sources is mainly contributed by the nonzero photon mass effect.
Photon mass limits have been earlier set through the optical emissions of the
Crab Nebula pulsar, but we prove that these limits can be significantly
improved with the dispersion measure (DM) measurements of radio pulsars in the
Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The combination of DM measurements of
pulsars and distances of the Magellanic Clouds provide a strict upper limit on
the photon mass as low as $m_{\gamma} \leq2.0\times10^{-45}~\rm{g}$, which is
at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the constraint from the Crab
Nebula pulsar. Although our limit is not as tight as the current best result
($\sim10^{-47}~\rm{g}$) from a fast radio burst (FRB 150418) at a cosmological
distance, the cosmological origin of FRB 150418 remains under debate; and our
limit can reach the same high precision of FRB 150418 when it has an
extragalactic origin ($\sim10^{-45}~\rm{g}$).

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as extragalactic sources which
can make a probe of turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and their host
galaxies. To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter
broadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density
fluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a
short-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly
supersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of
shock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the
required density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the
scattering timescale of FRBs. It implies that an FRB residing in a galaxy with
efficient star formation in action tends to have a broadened pulse. The scaling
of the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies
in different turbulence and scattering regimes. The host galaxy can be the
major origin of scatter broadening, but contribute to a small fraction of the
total DM. We also find that the sheet-like structure of density in the host ISM
associated with folded magnetic fields in a viscosity-dominated regime of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot give rise to strong scattering.
Furthermore, valuable insights into the IGM turbulence concerning the detailed
spatial structure of density and magnetic field can be gained from the observed
scattering timescale of FRBs. Our results are in favor of the suppression of
micro-plasma instabilities and the validity of collisional-MHD description of
turbulence properties in the collisionless IGM.

The excessive dispersion measures (DMs) and high Galactic latitudes of fast
radio bursts (FRBs) hint toward a cosmological origin of these mysterious
transients. Methods of using measured DM and redshift $z$ to study cosmology
have been proposed, but one needs to assume a certain amount of DM contribution
from the host galaxy (DM$_{\rm HG}$) in order to apply those methods. We
introduce a slope parameter $\beta(z) \equiv d \ln \left< {\rm DM}_{\rm E}
\right> / d \ln z$ (where DM$_{\rm E}$ is the observed DM subtracting the
Galactic contribution), which can be directly measured when a sample of FRBs
have $z$ measured. We show that $\left< {\rm DM_{HG}}\right>$ can be roughly
inferred from $\beta$ and the mean values, $\overline{\rm \left<DM_{\rm
E}\right>}$ and $\bar z$, of the sample. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we
show that the mean value of local host galaxy DM,
$\left<\rm{DM_{HG,loc}}\right>$, along with other cosmological parameters (mass
density $\Omega_m$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the IGM portion of the baryon
energy density $\Omega_b f_{\rm IGM}$) can be independently measured through
MCMC fitting to the data.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense radio flashes from the sky that are
characterized by millisecond durations and Jansky-level flux densities. We
carried out a statistical analysis on FRBs discovered. Their mean dispersion
measure, after subtracting the contribution from the interstellar medium of our
Galaxy, is found to be $\sim 660\,\rm pc\,cm^{-3}$, supporting their being from
cosmological origin. Their energy released in radio band spans about two orders
of magnitude, with a mean value of $\sim 10^{39}$ ergs. More interestingly,
although the FRB study is still in a very early phase, the published collection
of FRBs enables us to derive a useful intensity distribution function. For the
16 non-repeating FRBs detected by Parkes telescope and the Green Bank
Telescope, the intensity distribution can be described as $dN/dF_{\rm obs} =
(4.1 \pm 1.3) \times 10^3 \, F_{\rm obs}^{-1.1\pm0.2} \; \rm
sky^{-1}\,day^{-1}$, where $F_{\rm obs}$ is the observed radio fluence in units
of Jy~ms. Here the power-law index is significantly flatter than the expected
value of 2.5 for standard candles distributed homogeneously in a flat Euclidean
space. Based on this intensity distribution function, the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) will be able to detect about 5 FRBs
for every 1000 hours of observation time.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04815v1
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with a typical duration of 1 ms and 1 Jy flux
density at GHz frequencies, have brightness temperatures exceeding 1e33 K,
requiring a coherent emission process. This can be achieved by bunching
particles in volumes smaller than the typical wavelength, but this may be
challenging. Alternatively, we can have maser emission. Under certain
conditions, the synchrotron stimulated emission process can be more important
than true absorption, and a synchrotron maser can be created. This occurs when
the emitting electrons have a very narrow distribution of pitch angles and
energies. This process overcomes the difficulties of having extremely dense
bunches of particles and relaxes the light crossing time limits, since there is
no simple relation between the actual size of the source and the observed
variability timescale.

The observation of a possible electromagnetic counterpart by the Fermi GBM
group to the aLIGO detection of the merger of a black hole binary has spawned a
number of ideas about its source. Furthermore, observations of fast radio
bursts (FRBs) have similarly resulted in a range of new models that might endow
black hole binaries with electromagnetic signatures. In this context, even the
unlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is
worth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly
charged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a
black hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could
produce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM
($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$
assuming good radiative efficiency. However even a charge such as this is
difficult to imagine avoiding neutralization long enough for the binary to
produce its electromagnetic counterpart, and so this value would likely serve
simply as an upper bound. On the other hand, one can equivalently consider the
black holes as having acquired a magnetic monopole charge that would be easy to
maintain and would generate an identical electromagnetic signature as the
electric charges. The observation of such a binary would have significant
cosmological implications, not the least of which would be an explanation for
the quantization of charge itself. We also study such a magnetically charged
binary in the force-free regime and find it much more radiative, reducing even
further the requirements to produce the counterpart.

We investigate the nature of the compact, and possibly variable nuclear radio
source in the centre of WISE J0716-19, the proposed host galaxy of fast radio
burst, FRB 150418. We observed WISE J0716-19 at 5.0 GHz with the European VLBI
Network four times between 2016 March 16 and June 2. At three epochs, we
simultaneously observed the source with e-MERLIN at the same frequency. We
detected a compact source in the EVN data in each epoch with a significance up
to ~8sigma. The four epochs yielded consistent results within their
uncertainties, for both peak surface intensity and positions. The mean values
for these quantities are I_peak = (115+-9) {\mu}Jy/beam and r.a. =
07:16:34.55496(7), dec. = -19:00:39.4754(8), respectively. The e-MERLIN data
provided ~3-5sigma detections, at a position consistent with those of the EVN
data. The presence of emission on angular scales intermediate between the EVN
and e-MERLIN is consistent with being null. The brightness temperature of the
EVN core is Tb~10^8.5K, close to the value required by Akiyama & Johnson (2016)
to explain the radio properties of WISE J0716-19 in terms of interstellar
induced short-term variability. Our observations provide direct, independent
evidence of the existence of a nuclear compact source in WISE J0716-19, a
physical scenario with no evident connection with FRB 150418. However, the EVN
data do not show indication of the variability observed with the VLA.

The possibility that part of the dark matter is made of massive compact halo
objects (MACHOs) remains poorly constrained over a wide range of masses, and
especially in the $20-100\, M_\odot$ window. We show that strong gravitational
lensing of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) by MACHOs of masses larger
than $\sim20\,M_\odot$ would result in repeated FRBs with an observable time
delay. Strong lensing of an FRB by a lens of mass $M_L$ induces two images,
separated by a typical time delay $\sim$ few $\times(M_L/30\, M_\odot)$
milliseconds. Considering the expected FRB detection rate by upcoming
experiments, such as CHIME, of $10^4$ FRBs per year, we should observe from
tens to hundreds of repeated bursts yearly, if MACHOs in this window make up
all the dark matter. A null search for echoes with just $10^4$ FRBs, would
constrain the fraction $f_{\rm DM}$ of dark matter in MACHOs to $f_{\rm
DM}\lesssim 0.08$ for $M_L\gtrsim 20\,M_\odot$.

We report on a search for host galaxies of a subset of Rotating Radio
Transients (RRATs) that possess a dispersion measure (DM) near or above the
maximum Galactic value in their direction. These RRATs could have an
extragalactic origin and therefore be Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The sizes of
related galaxies on the sky at such short distances are comparable to the beam
size of a single-dish telescope (for example, the $7.0'$ radius of the Parkes
beam). Hence the association, if found, could be more definitive as compared to
finding host galaxies for more distant FRBs. We did not find any host galaxy
associated with six RRATs near the maximum Galactic DM. This result is
consistent with the fact that the probability of finding an FRB host galaxy
within this volume is also very small. We propose that future follow-up
observations of such RRATs be carried out in searching for local host galaxies
as well as the sources of FRBs.

The discoveries of GW 150914, GW 151226, and LVT 151012 suggest that double
black hole (BH-BH) mergers are common in the universe. If at least one of the
two merging black holes carries certain amount of charge, possibly retained by
a rotating magnetosphere, the inspiral of a BH-BH system would drive a global
magnetic dipole normal to the orbital plane. The rapidly evolving magnetic
moment during the merging process would drive a Poynting flux with an
increasing wind power. The magnetospheric activities during the final phase of
the merger would make a fast radio burst (FRB) if the BH charge can be as large
as a factor of $\hat q \sim (10^{-9}-10^{-8})$ of the critical charge $Q_c$ of
the BH. At large radii, dissipation of the Poynting flux energy in the outflow
would power a short duration high-energy transient, which would appear as a
detectable short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) if the charge can be as large
as $\hat q \sim (10^{-5}-10^{-4})$. The putative short GRB coincident with GW
150914 recorded by Fermi GBM may be interpreted with this model. Future joint
GW/GRB/FRB searches would lead to a measurement or place a constraint on the
charges carried by isolate black holes.

We analyse archival data from the Parkes radio telescope which was observing
a location 35.6$^\circ$ away from SGR 1806-20 during its giant $\gamma$-ray
flare of 2004 December 27. We show that no FRB-like burst counterpart was
detected, and set a radio limit of 110\,MJy at 1.4 GHz, including the estimated
70\,dB suppression of the signal due to its location in the far side lobe of
Parkes and the predicted scattering from the interstellar medium. The upper
limit for the magnetar giant flare radio to $\gamma$-ray fluence ratio is
$\eta_\mathrm{SGR} \lesssim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{Jy\,ms\,erg^{-1}\,cm^{2}}$. Based
on the non-detection of a short and prompt $\gamma$-ray counterpart of fifteen
FRBs in $\gamma$-ray transient monitors, we set a lower limit on the fluence
ratios of FRBs to be $\eta_\mathrm{FRB} \gtrsim
10^{7-9}\,\mathrm{Jy\,ms\,erg^{-1}\,cm^{2}}$. The fluence ratio limit for \sgr\
is inconsistent with all but one of the fifteen FRBs. We discuss possible
variations in the magnetar-FRB emission mechanism and observational caveats
that may reconcile the theory with observations.

The nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains enigmatic. Highly energetic
radio pulses of millisecond duration, FRBs are observed with dispersion
measures consistent with an extragalactic source. A variety of models have been
proposed to explain their origin. One popular class of theorized FRB progenitor
is the coalescence of compact binaries composed of neutron stars and/or black
holes. Such coalescence events are strong gravitational-wave emitters. We
demonstrate that measurements made by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave
observatories can be leveraged to severely constrain the validity of FRB binary
coalescence models. Existing measurements constrain the binary black hole rate
to approximately $5\%$ of the FRB rate, and results from Advanced LIGO's O1 and
O2 observing runs may place similarly strong constraints on the fraction of
FRBs due to binary neutron star and neutron star--black hole progenitors.

The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is a new
400-800MHz radio interferometer under development for deployment in South
Africa. HIRAX will comprise 1024 six meter parabolic dishes on a compact grid
and will map most of the southern sky over the course of four years. HIRAX has
two primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at
high redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe
unresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line
(`hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at
redshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).
HIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by
observing a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift
range) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the
universe transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a
hydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing
the sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern
Hemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with
large-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths. Daily maps of a few thousand
square degrees of the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing much of the Milky Way
galaxy, will also open new opportunities for discovering and monitoring radio
transients. The HIRAX correlator will have the ability to rapidly and
eXperimentciently detect transient events. This new data will shed light on the
poorly understood nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), enable pulsar monitoring
to enhance long-wavelength gravitational wave searches, and provide a rich data
set for new radio transient phenomena searches. This paper discusses the HIRAX
instrument, science goals, and current status.

Very recently Spitler et al. (2016) and Scholz et al. (2016) reported their
detections of sixteen additional bright bursts from the direction of the fast
radio burst (FRB) 121102. This repeating FRB is inconsistent with all the
catastrophic event models put forward previously for hypothetically
non-repeating FRBs. Here we propose a different model, in which highly
magnetized pulsars travel through asteroid belts of other stars. We show that a
repeating FRB could originate from such a pulsar encountering lots of asteroids
in the belt. During each pulsar-asteroid impact, an electric field induced
outside the asteroid has such a large component parallel to the stellar
magnetic field that electrons are torn off the asteroidal surface and
accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies instantaneously. Subsequent movement
of these electrons along magnetic field lines will cause coherent curvature
radiation, which can account for all the properties of an FRB. In addition,
this model can self-consistently explain the typical duration, luminosity, and
repetitive rate of the seventeen bursts of FRB 121102. The predicted occurrence
rate of repeating FRB sources may imply that our model would be testable in the
next few years.

Time domain radio astronomy observing campaigns frequently generate large
volumes of data. Our goal is to develop automated methods that can identify
events of interest buried within the larger data stream. The V-FASTR fast
transient system was designed to detect rare fast radio bursts (FRBs) within
data collected by the Very Long Baseline Array. The resulting event candidates
constitute a significant burden in terms of subsequent human reviewing time. We
have trained and deployed a machine learning classifier that marks each
candidate detection as a pulse from a known pulsar, an artifact due to radio
frequency interference, or a potential new discovery. The classifier maintains
high reliability by restricting its predictions to those with at least 90%
confidence. We have also implemented several efficiency and usability
improvements to the V-FASTR web-based candidate review system. Overall, we
found that time spent reviewing decreased and the fraction of interesting
candidates increased. The classifier now classifies (and therefore filters)
80-90% of the candidates, with an accuracy greater than 98%, leaving only the
10-20% most promising candidates to be reviewed by humans.

Fast radio bursts (FRB) are millisecond-duration radio pulses with apparent
extragalactic origins. All but two of the FRBs have been discovered using the
Parkes dish which employs multiple beams formed by an array of feed horns on
its focal plane. In this paper, we show that (i) the preponderance of
multiple-beam detections, and (ii) the detection rates for varying dish
diameters, can be used to infer the index $\alpha$ of the cumulative fluence
distribution function (the log$N$-log$F$ function: $\alpha=1.5$ for a
non-evolving population in a Euclidean universe). If all detected FRBs arise
from a single progenitor population, multiple-beam FRB detection rates from the
Parkes telescope yield the constraint $0.52<\alpha<1.0$ with $90$% confidence.
Searches at other facilities with different dish sizes refine the constraint to
$0.66<\alpha<0.96$. Our results favor FRB searches with smaller dishes, because
for $\alpha<1$, the gain in field-of-view for a smaller dish is more important
than the reduction in sensitivity. Further, our results suggest that (i) FRBs
are not standard candles, and (ii) the distribution of distances to the
detected FRBs is weighted towards larger distances. If FRBs are extragalactic,
these results are consistent with a cosmological population, which would make
FRBs excellent probes of the baryonic content and geometry of the Universe.

We investigate whether current data on the distribution of observed flux
densities of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are consistent with a constant source
density in Euclidean space. We use the number of FRBs detected in two surveys
with different characteristics along with the observed signal-to-noise ratios
of the detected FRBs in a formalism similar to a V/V_max-test to constrain the
distribution of flux densities. We find consistency between the data and a
Euclidean distribution. Any extension of this model is therefore not
data-driven and needs to be motivated separately. As a byproduct we also obtain
new improved limits for the FRB rate at 1.4 GHz, which had not been constrained
in this way before.

A radio source that faded over six days, with a redshift of $z\approx0.5$
host, has been identified by Keane et al. (2016) as the transient afterglow to
a fast radio burst (FRB 150418). We report follow-up radio and optical
observations of the afterglow candidate and find a source that is consistent
with an active galactic nucleus. If the afterglow candidate is nonetheless a
prototypical FRB afterglow, existing slow-transient surveys limit the fraction
of FRBs that produce afterglows to 0.25 for afterglows with fractional
variation, $m=2|S_1-S_2|/(S_1+S_2)\geq0.7$, and 0.07 for $m\geq1$, at 95%
confidence. In anticipation of a barrage of bursts expected from future FRB
surveys, we provide a simple framework for statistical association of FRBs with
afterglows. Our framework properly accounts for statistical uncertainties, and
ensures consistency with limits set by slow-transient surveys.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond bursts of radio radiation whose
progenitors so far remain mysterious. Nevertheless, the timescales and
energetics of the events have lead to many theories associating FRBs with young
neutron stars. Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young
supernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational
consequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into
the interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back
through the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM)
associated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM. Times when DM is
high are generally overshadowed by free-free absorption, which, depending on
the mass of the ejecta and the density of the ISM, may be probed at frequencies
of $400\,{\rm MHz}$ to $1.4\,{\rm GHz}$ on timescales of $\sim100-500\,{\rm
yrs}$ after the SN. Magnetic fields generated at the reverse shock may be high
enough to explain Faraday rotation that has been measured for one FRB. If FRBs
are powered by the spin energy of a young NS (rather than magnetic energy), the
NS must have a magnetic field $\lesssim10^{11}-10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ to ensure that
it does not spin down too quickly while the SNR is still optically thick at
radio frequencies. In the future, once there are distance measurements to FRBs
and their energetics are better understood, the spin of the NS can also be
constrained.

There are several phenomenological similarities between Soft Gamma Repeaters
and Fast Radio Bursts, including duty factors, time scales and probable
repetition. The sudden release of magnetic energy in a neutron star
magnetosphere, as in popular models of SGR, can meet the energy requirements of
FRB but requires both the presence of magnetospheric plasma in order that
dissipation occur in a transparent region and a mechanism for releasing much of
that energy quickly. FRB sources and SGR are distinguished by long-lived (up to
thousands of years) current-carrying coronal arches remaining from formation of
the young neutron star and their decay ends the phase of SGR/AXP/FRB activity
even though "magnetar" fields may persist. Runaway increase in resistance when
the current density exceeds a threshold releases magnetostatic energy in a
sudden burst and produces high brightness GHz emission of FRB by a coherent
process; SGR are produced when released energy thermalizes as an equilibrium
pair plasma. Failures of some alternative FRB models and the non-detection of
SGR~1806-20 at radio frequencies are discussed in appendices.

We discuss possible electromagnetic signals accompanying Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs) that are expected in the scenario where FRBs originate in neutron star
magnetospheres. For models involving Crab-like giant pulses, no appreciable
contemporaneous emission is expected at other wavelengths. Magnetar giant
flares, driven by the reconfiguration of the magnetosphere, however, can
produce both contemporaneous bursts at other wavelengths as well as
afterglow-like emission. We conclude that the best chances are: (i) prompt
short GRB-like emission; (ii) a contemporaneous optical flash that can reach
naked eye peak luminosity (but only for a few milliseconds); (iii) a high
energy afterglow emission. Case (i) could be tested by coordinated radio and
high-energy experiments. Case (ii) could be seen in a coordinated radio-optical
surveys, \eg\ by the Palomar Transient Factory in a 60-second frame as a
transient object of $m=15-20$ magnitude with an expected optical detection rate
of about 0.1~hr$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than in radio. Shallow,
but large-area sky surveys such as ASAS-SN and EVRYSCOPE could also detect
prompt optical flashes from the more powerful Lorimer-burst clones. The best
constraints on the optical-to-radio power for this kind of emission could be
provided by future observations with facilities like LSST. Case (iii) might be
seen in relatively rare cases that the relativistically ejected magnetic blob
is moving along the line of sight.

Estimating the all-sky rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been difficult
due to small-number statistics and the fact that they are seen by disparate
surveys in different regions of the sky. In this paper we provide limits for
the FRB rate at 800 MHz based on the only burst detected at frequencies below
1.4 GHz, FRB 110523. We discuss the difficulties in rate estimation,
particularly in providing an all-sky rate above a single fluence threshold. We
find an implied rate between 700-900 MHz that is consistent with the rate at
1.4 GHz, scaling to $6.4^{+29.5}_{-5.0} \times 10^3$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$
for an HTRU-like survey. This is promising for upcoming experiments below a GHz
like CHIME and UTMOST, for which we forecast detection rates. Given 110523's
discovery at 32$\sigma$ with nothing weaker detected, down to the threshold of
8$\sigma$, we find consistency with a Euclidean flux distribution but disfavour
steep distributions, ruling out $\gamma > 2.2$.

We report on a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment on giant
radio pulses (GPs) from the Crab pulsar in the radio 1.4 to 1.7 GHz range to
demonstrate a VLBI technique for searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs). We
carried out the experiment on 26 July 2014 using the Kashima 34 m and Usuda 64
m radio telescopes of the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) with a baseline of about
200 km. During the approximately 1 h observation, we could detect 35 GPs by
high-time-resolution VLBI. Moreover, we determined the dispersion measure (DM)
to be 56.7585 +/- 0.0025 on the basis of the mean DM of the 35 GPs detected by
VLBI. We confirmed that the sensitivity of a detection of GPs using our
technique is superior to that of a single-dish mode detection using the same
telescope.

The V-FASTR experiment on the Very Long Baseline Array was designed to detect
dispersed pulses of milliseconds duration, such as fast radio bursts (FRBs). We
use all V-FASTR data through February 2015 to report V-FASTR's upper limits on
the rates of FRBs, and compare these with re-derived rates from Parkes FRB
detection experiments. V-FASTR's operation at lambda=20 cm allows direct
comparison with the 20 cm Parkes rate, and we derive a power-law limit of
\gamma<-0.4 (95% confidence limit) on the index of FRB source counts,
N(>S)\propto S^\gamma. Using the previously measured FRB rate and the
unprecedented amount of survey time spent searching for FRBs at a large range
of wavelengths (0.3 cm > \lambda > 90 cm), we also place frequency-dependent
limits on the spectral distribution of FRBs. The most constraining frequencies
place two-point spectral index limits of \alpha_{20cm}^{4cm} < 5.8 and
\alpha_{90cm}^{20cm} > -7.6, where fluence F \propto f^\alpha if we assume true
the burst rate reported by Champion et al. (2016) of R(F~0.6 Jy ms) = 7 x 10^3
sky^{-1} day^{-1} (for bursts of ~3 ms duration). This upper limit on \alpha
suggests that if FRBs are extragalactic but non-cosmological, that on average
they are not experiencing excessive free-free absorption due to a medium with
high optical depth (assuming temperature ~8,000 K), which excessively invert
their low-frequency spectrum. This in turn implies that the dispersion of FRBs
arises in either or both of the intergalactic medium or the host galaxy, rather
than from the source itself.

We have searched three Parkes multibeam 1.4 GHz surveys for the presence of
fast radio bursts (FRBs) out to a dispersion measure (DM) of 5000 pc cm$^{-3}$.
These surveys originally targeted the Magellanic Clouds (in two cases) and
unidentified gamma-ray sources at mid-Galactic latitudes (in the third case)
for new radio pulsars. In previous processing, none of these surveys were
searched to such a high DM limit. The surveys had a combined total of 719 hr of
Parkes multibeam on-sky time. One known FRB, 010724, was present in our data
and was detected in our analysis but no new FRBs were found. After adding in
the on-sky Parkes time from these three surveys to the on-sky time (7512 hr)
from the five Parkes surveys analysed by Rane et al., all of which have now
been searched to high DM limits, we improve the constraint on the all-sky rate
of FRBs above a fluence level of 3.8 Jy ms at 1.4 GHz to $R = 3.3^{+3.7}_{-2.2}
\times 10^{3}$ events per day per sky (at the 99% confidence level). Future
Parkes surveys that accumulate additional multibeam on-sky time (such as the
ongoing high-resolution Parkes survey of the LMC) can be combined with these
results to further constrain the all-sky FRB rate.

We analyze plasma dispersion and scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to
identify the dominant locations of free electrons along their lines of sight
and thus constrain the distances of the burst sources themselves. We establish
the average $\tau$-DM relation for Galactic pulsars and use it as a benchmark
for discussing FRB scattering. Though scattering times $\tau$ for FRBs are
large in the majority of the 17 events we analyze, they are systematically
smaller than those of Galactic pulsars that have similar dispersion measures
(DMs). The lack of any correlation between $\tau$ and DM for FRBs suggests that
the intergalactic medium (IGM) cannot account for both $\tau$ and DM. We
therefore consider mixed models involving the IGM and host galaxies. If the IGM
contributes significantly to DM while host galaxies dominate $\tau$, the
scattering deficit with respect to the mean Galactic trend can be explained
with a $\tau$-DM relation in the host that matches that for the Milky Way.
However, it is possible that hosts dominate both $\tau$ and DM, in which case
the observed scattering deficits require free electrons in the host to be less
turbulent than in the Galaxy, such as if they are in hot rather than warm
ionized regions. Our results imply that distances or redshifts of FRB sources
can be significantly overestimated if they are based on the assumption that the
extragalactic portion of DM is dominated by the IGM.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients lasting only about a few
milliseconds. They seem to occur at cosmological distances. We propose that
these events can be originated in the collapse of the magnetosphere of
Kerr-Newman black holes (KNBHs). We show that the closed orbits of charged
particles in the magnetosphere of these objects are unstable. After examining
the dependencies on the specific charge of the particle and the spin and charge
of the KNBH, we conclude that the resulting timescale and radiation mechanism
fit well with the extant observations of FRBs. Furthermore, we argue that the
merger of a KNBH binary is one of the plausible central engines for potential
gamma-ray or radio afterglow following a certain FRBs, and can also account for
gravitational wave (GW) events like GW 150914. Our model leads to predictions
that can be tested by combined multi-wavelength electromagnetic and GW
observations.

Assuming: fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by neutron stars at
cosmological distances; FRB rate tracks core-collapse supernova rate; and all
FRBs repeat with a universal energy distribution function (EDF) dN/dE ~
E^(-beta) with a high-end cutoff at burst energy E_max. We find that
observations so far are consistent with a universal EDF with a power-law index
1.5 < beta < 2.2, high-end cutoff E_max/E_0 > 30 and normalization N_0 < 2 per
day; where N_0 is the integrated rate above the reference burst energy E_0 =
1.2e39 f_r^(-1) erg (f_r is the radio emission efficiency). Implications of
such an EDF are discussed.

Keane et al. (2016) have recently reported the discovery of a new fast radio
burst, FRB150418, with a promising radio counterpart at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz -- a
rapidly decaying source, falling from 200-300 $\mu$Jy to 100 $\mu$Jy on
timescales of $\sim$6 d. This transient source may be associated with an
elliptical galaxy at redshift $z=0.492$, providing the first firm spectroscopic
redshift for a FRB and the ability to estimate the density of baryons in the
intergalactic medium via the combination of known redshift and radio dispersion
of the FRB. An alternative explanation, first suggested by Williams & Berger
(2016b), is that the identified counterpart may instead be a compact AGN. The
putative counterpart's variation may then instead be extrinsic, caused by
refractive scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium of the Milky Way,
which would invalidate the association with FRB150418. We examine this latter
explanation in detail and show that the reported observations are consistent
with scintillating radio emission from the core of a radio-loud active galactic
nucleus (AGN) having a brightness temperature $T_{\rm b} \gtrsim 10^9 {\rm K}$.
Using numerical simulations of the expected scattering for the line of sight to
FRB150418, we provide example images and light curves of such an AGN at 5.5 and
7.5 GHz. These results can be compared with continued radio monitoring to
conclusively determine the importance of scintillation for the observed radio
variability, and they show that scintillation is a critical consideration for
continued searches for FRB counterparts at radio wavelengths.

Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond bursts of radio radiation at frequencies of
about 1 GHz, recently discovered in pulsar surveys. They have not yet been
definitively identified with any other astronomical object or phenomenon. The
bursts are strongly dispersed, indicating passage through a high column density
of low density plasma. The most economical interpretation is that this is the
interglactic medium, indicating that FRB are at "cosmological" distances with
redshifts in the range 0.3--1.3. Their inferred brightness temperatures are as
high as $10^{37\,\circ}$K, implying coherent emission by "bunched" charges, as
in radio pulsars. I review the astronomical sites, objects and emission
processes that have been proposed as the origin of FRB, with particular
attention to Soft Gamma Repeaters and giant pulsar pulses.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05336v2
We propose a compact binary model for the fast radio burst (FRB) repeaters,
where the system consists of a magnetic white dwarf (WD) and a neutron star
(NS) with strong bipolar magnetic fields. When the WD fills its Roche lobe,
mass transfer will occur from the WD to the NS through the inner Lagrange
point. The accreted magnetized materials may trigger magnetic reconnection when
they approach the NS surface, and therefore the electrons can be accelerated to
an ultra-relativistic speed. In this scenario, the curvature radiation of the
electrons moving along the NS magnetic field lines can account for the
characteristic frequency and the timescale of an FRB. Owing to the conservation
of angular momentum, the WD may be kicked away after a burst, and the next
burst may appear when the system becomes semi-detached again through the
gravitational radiation. By comparing our analyses with the observations, we
show that such an intermittent Roche lobe overflow mechanism can be responsible
for the observed repeating behavior of FRB 121102.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03235v2
We examine the proposal that the dispersion measures (DMs) and Faraday
rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic linearly-polarized fast radio bursts
(FRBs) can be used to probe the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in
filaments of galaxies. The DM through the cosmic web is dominated by
contributions from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in filaments and
from the gas in voids. On the other hand, RM is induced mostly by the hot
medium in galaxy clusters, and only a fraction of it is produced in the WHIM.
We show that if one excludes FRBs whose sightlines pass through galaxy
clusters, the line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments, $B_{||}$, is
approximately $C(\langle 1+z \rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$, where $C$ is a known
constant. Here, the redshift of the FRB is not required to be known; $f_{DM}$
is the fraction of total DM due to the WHIM, while $\langle 1+z \rangle$ is the
redshift of interevening gas weighted by the WHIM gas density, both of which
can be evaluated for a given cosmology model solely from the DM of an FRB.
Using data on structure formation simulations and a model IGMF, we show that
$C(\langle 1+z \rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$ closely reproduces the density-weighted
line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments of the large-scale structure.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01992v1
We discuss identification of possible counterparts and persistent sources
related to Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in the framework of the model of supergiant
pulses from young neutron stars with large spin-down luminosities. In
particular, we demonstrate that at least some of sources of FRBs can be
observed as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). At the moment no ULXs are known
to be coincident with localization areas of FRBs. We searched for a correlation
of FRB positions with galaxies in the 2MASS Redshift survey catalogue. Our
analysis produced statistically insignificant overabundance ($p$-value $\approx
4\%$) of galaxies in error boxes of FRBs. In the very near future with even
modestly increased statistics of FRBs and with the help of dedicated X-ray
observations and all-sky X-ray surveys it will be possible to decisively prove
or falsify the supergiant pulses model.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02513v2
In this paper we consider the fact that the simple criterion used to label
fast radio transient events as either fast radio bursts (FRBs, thought to be
extragalactic with as yet unknown progenitors) or rotating radio transients
(RRATs, thought to be Galactic neutron stars) is uncertain. We identify single
pulse events reported in the literature which have never been seen to repeat,
and which have been labelled as RRATs, but are potentially mis-labelled FRBs.
We examine the probability that such `grey area' events are within the Milky
Way. The uncertainty in the RRAT/FRB labelling criterion, as well as
Galactic-latitude dependent reporting bias may be contributing to the observed
latitude dependence of the FRB rate, in addition to effects such as Eddington
bias due to scintillation.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.09135v2
The frequency-dependent time delays in fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used
to constrain the photon mass, if the FRB redshifts are known, but the
similarity between the frequency dependences of dispersion due to plasma
effects and a photon mass complicates the derivation of a limit on $m_\gamma$.
The dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 150418 is known to $\sim 0.1$%, and there is
a claim to have measured its redshift with an accuracy of $\sim 2$%, but the
strength of the constraint on $m_\gamma$ is limited by uncertainties in the
modelling of the host galaxy and the Milky Way, as well as possible
inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Allowing for these
uncertainties, the recent data on FRB 150418 indicate that $m_\gamma \lesssim
1.8 \times 10^{-14}$eV c$^{-2}$ ($3.2 \times 10^{-50}$kg), if FRB 150418 indeed
has a redshift $z = 0.492$ as initially reported. In the future, the different
redshift dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to DM can be
used to improve the sensitivity to $m_\gamma$ if more FRB redshifts are
measured. For a fixed fractional uncertainty in the extra-galactic contribution
to the DM of an FRB, one with a lower redshift would provide greater
sensitivity to $m_\gamma$.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02014v2
In this paper we propose that a fast radio burst (FRB) could originate from
the magnetic interaction between double neutron stars (NSs) during their final
inspiral within the framework of a unipolar inductor model. In this model, an
electromotive force is induced on one NS to accelerate electrons to an
ultra-relativistic speed instantaneously. We show that coherent curvature
radiation from these electrons moving along magnetic field lines in the
magnetosphere of the other NS is responsible for the observed FRB signal, that
is, the characteristic emission frequency, luminosity, duration and event rate
of FRBs can be well understood. In addition, we discuss several implications of
this model, including double-peaked FRBs and possible associations of FRBs with
short-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07835v2
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio bursts characterized by millisecond
durations, high Galactic latitude positions, and high dispersion measures. Very
recently, the cosmological origin of FRB 150418 has been confirmed by
\cite{kea16}, and FRBs are now strong competitors as cosmological probes. The
simple sharp feature of the FRB signal is ideal for them to probe some of the
fundamental laws of physics. Here we show that by analyzing the delay time
between different frequencies, the FRB data can place stringent upper limits on
the rest mass of the photon. For FRB 150418 at $z=0.492$, one can potentially
reach $m_{\gamma} \leq 5.2 \times 10^{-47}$ g, which is $10^{20}$ times smaller
than the rest mass of electron, and is about $10^3$ times smaller than that
obtained using other astrophysical sources with the same method.

Keane et al. recently detected a fading radio source following FRB 150418,
leading to the identification of a putative host galaxy at $z = 0.492 \pm
0.008$. Assuming that the fading source is the afterglow of FRB 150418, I model
the afterglow and constrain the isotropic energy of the explosion to be a few
$10^{50}$ erg, comparable to that of a short duration GRB. The outflow may have
a jet opening angle of $\sim 0.22$ rad, so that the beaming-corrected energy is
below $10^{49}$ erg. The results rule out most FRB progenitor models for this
FRB, but may be consistent with either of the following two scenarios. The
first scenario invokes a merger of an NS-NS binary, which produced an
undetected short GRB and a supra-massive neutron star, which subsequently
collapsed into a black hole, probably 100s of seconds after the short GRB. The
second scenario invokes a merger of a compact star binary (BH-BH, NS-NS, or
BH-NS) system whose pre-merger dynamical magnetospheric activities made the
FRB, which is followed by an undetected short GRB-like transient. The
gravitational wave (GW) event GW150914 would be a sister of FRB 150418 in this
second scenario. In both cases, one expects an exciting prospect of GW/FRB/GRB
associations.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03615v2
The distances of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources are currently unknown. We
show that the 21-cm absorption line of hydrogen can be used to infer the
redshifts of FRB sources, and determine whether they are Galactic or
extragalactic. We calculate a probability of $\sim 10\%$ for the host galaxy of
an FRB to exhibit a 21-cm absorption feature of equivalent width $\gtrsim 10
~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Arecibo, along with several future radio
observatories, should be capable of detecting such associated 21-cm absorption
signals for strong bursts of $\gtrsim {\rm several}~\mathrm{Jy}$ peak flux
densities.

We present Clusterrank, a new algorithm for identifying dispersed
astrophysical pulses. Such pulses are commonly detected from Galactic pulsars
and rotating radio transients (RRATs), which are neutron stars with sporadic
radio emission. More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast
radio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an
extragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs.
Clusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo
327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327). The new RRATs have DMs in the range $23.5
- 86.6$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the range $0.172 - 3.901$ s. The new
pulsars have DMs in the range $23.6 - 133.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the
range $1.249 - 5.012$ s, and include two nullers and a mode-switching object.
We estimate an upper limit on the all-sky FRB rate of $10^5$ day$^{-1}$ for
bursts with a width of 10 ms and flux density $\gtrsim 83$ mJy. The DMs of all
new discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin. In comparing statistics
of the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are
drawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we find that the period
distribution of the new pulsars is different from the period distributions of
canonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327 data by a
periodicity search. This indicates that Clusterrank is a powerful complement to
periodicity searches and uncovers a subset of the pulsar population that has so
far been underrepresented in survey results and therefore in Galactic pulsar
population models.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08434v3
Keane et al. have recently claimed to have obtained the first precise
localization for a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) thanks to the identification of a
contemporaneous fading slow (~week-timescale) radio transient. They use this
localization to pinpoint the FRB to a galaxy at z ~ 0.49 that exhibits no
discernable star formation activity. We argue that the transient is not genuine
and that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio
variable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio
variable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift
compatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light
curve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also
showing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting
blastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN
and we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the
galaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient.
Therefore the claimed precise localization and redshift determination for FRB
150418 cannot be justified.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05509v3
Popular models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) involve the gravitational collapse
of neutron star progenitors to black holes. It has been proposed that the
shedding of the strong neutron star magnetic field ($B$) during the collapse is
the power source for the radio emission. Previously, these models have utilized
the simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the
magnetic flux is magnetic "hair" that must be shed before final collapse. But,
neutron stars have angular momentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr
Newman solution exists in which $B$ has its source inside of the event horizon.
In this letter, we consider the magnetic flux to be shed as a consequence of
the electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state of a Kerr Newman black
hole. It has also been argued that the shedding model will not operate due to
pair creation. By considering the pulsar death line, we find that for a neutron
star with $B = 10^{11} - 10^{13}$ G and a long rotation period, $>1$ s this is
not a concern. We also discuss the observational evidence supporting the
plausibility of magnetic flux shedding models of FRBs that are spawned from
rapidly rotating progenitors.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04825v1
Recently, Keane et al. reported the discovery of a fading radio transient
following FRB 150418, and interpreted it as the afterglow of the FRB. Williams
\& Berger, on the other hand, suggested that the radio transient is analogous
to a group of variable radio sources, so that it could be a coincident AGN
flare in the observational beam of the FRB. A new observation with VLA showed a
re-brightening, which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio
survey data of Ofek et al., we statistically examine the chance coincidence
probability to produce an event like the FRB 150418 transient. We find that the
probabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same
variability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient,
without and with the VLA point, are $P_1 \sim 6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $P_1 \sim 2
\times 10^{-3}$, respectively. In addition, the chance probability to have a
fading transient detected following a random time (FRB time) is less than $P_2
\sim 10^{-2.9\pm 1.3}$. Putting these together and assuming that the number of
radio sources within one Parkes beam is 16, the final chance coincidence of
having an FRB 150418-like radio transient to be unrelated to the FRB is $<
10^{-4.9\pm1.3}$ and $< 10^{-4.4\pm1.3}$, respectively, without and with the
VLA point. We conclude that the radio transient following FRB 150418 has a low
probability being an unrelated AGN flare, and the possibility of being the
afterglow of FRB 150418 is not ruled out.

Fast Radio Bursts have recently been used to place limits on Einstein's
Equivalence Principle via observations of time delays between photons of
different radio frequencies by \citet{wei15}. These limits on differential
post-Newtonian parameters ($\Delta \gamma<2.52\times10^{-8}$) are the best yet
achieved but still rely on uncertain assumptions, namely the relative
contributions of dispersion and gravitational delays to the observed time
delays and the distances to FRBs. Also very recently, the first FRB host galaxy
has likely been identified, providing the first redshift-based distance
estimate to FRB 150418 \citep{kea16}. Moreover, consistency between the
\omegaigm\ estimate from FRB 150418 and \omegaigm~expected from $\Lambda$CDM
models and WMAP observations leads one to conclude that the observed time delay
for FRB 150418 is highly dominated by dispersion, with any gravitational delays
small contributors. This points to even tighter limits on $\Delta \gamma$. In
this paper, the technique of \citet{wei15} is applied to FRB 150418 to produce
a limit of $\Delta \gamma < 1 - 2\times10^{-9}$, approximately an order of
magnitude better than previous limits and in line with expectations by
\citet{wei15} for what could be achieved if the dispersive delay is separated
from other effects. Future substantial improvements in such limits will depend
on accurately determining the contribution of individual ionized components to
the total observed time delays for FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02891v1
We discuss possible association of fast radio bursts (FRBs) with supergiant
pulses emitted by young pulsars (ages $\sim$ tens to hundreds of years) born
with regular magnetic field but very short -- few milliseconds -- spin periods.
FRBs are extra-Galactic events coming from distances $d \lesssim 100$ Mpc. Most
of the dispersion measure (DM) comes from the material in the freshly ejected
SNR shell; for a given burst the DM should decrease with time. FRBs are not
expected to be seen below $\sim 300 $ MHz due to free-free absorption in the
expanding ejecta. A supernova might have been detected years before the burst;
FRBs are mostly associated with star forming galaxies.
  The model requires that some pulsars are born with very fast spins, of the
order of few milliseconds. The observed distribution of spin-down powers
$\dot{E}$ in young energetic pulsars is consistent with equal birth rate per
decade of $\dot{E}$. Accepting this injection spectrum and scaling the
intrinsic brightness of FRBs with $\dot{E}$, we predict the following
properties of a large sample of FRBs: (i) the brightest observed events come
from a broad distribution in distances; (ii) for repeating bursts brightness
either remains nearly constant (if the spin-down time is longer than the age of
the pulsar) or decreases with time otherwise; in the latter case DM $\propto
\dot{E}$.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05013v2
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious transient sources. If extragalactic,
as suggested by their relative large dispersion measures, their brightness
temperatures must be extremely high. Some FRB models (e.g. young pulsar model,
magnetar giant flare model, or supra-massive neutron star collapse model)
suggest that they may be associated with a synchrotron nebula. Here we study a
synchrotron-heating process by an FRB in a self-absorbed synchrotron nebula. If
the FRB frequency is below the synchrotron self-absorption frequency of the
nebula, electrons in the nebula would absorb FRB photons, leading to a harder
electron spectrum and enhanced self-absorbed synchrotron emission. In the
meantime, the FRB flux is absorbed by the nebula electrons. We calculate the
spectra of FRB-heated synchrotron nebulae, and show that the nebula spectra
would show a significant hump in several decades near the self-absorption
frequency. Identifying such a spectral feature would reveal an embedded FRB in
a synchrotron nebula.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07544v1
We present a survey for transient and variable sources, on timescales from 28
seconds to $\sim$1 year, using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) at 182 MHz.
Down to a detection threshold of 0.285 Jy, no transient candidates were
identified, making this the most constraining low-frequency survey to date and
placing a limit on the surface density of transients of $<4.1 \times 10^{-7}$
deg$^{-2}$ for the shortest timescale considered. At these frequencies,
emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is expected to be detectable in the
shortest timescale images without any corrections for interstellar or
intergalactic dispersion. At an FRB limiting flux density of 7980 Jy, we find a
rate of $<$82 FRBs per sky per day for dispersion measures $<$700 pc cm$^{-3}$.
Assuming a cosmological population of standard candles, our rate limits are
consistent with the FRB rates obtained by Thornton et al. (2013) if they have a
flat spectral slope. Finally, we conduct an initial variability survey of
sources in the field with flux densities $\gtrsim$0.5 Jy and identify no
sources with significant variability in their lightcurves. However, we note
that substantial further work is required to fully characterise both the short
term and low level variability within this field.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transient signals
discovered over the past decade. Here we describe the scientific usefulness of
FRBs, consider ongoing work at the Parkes telescope, and examine some relevant

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are apparently one-time, relatively bright radio
pulses that have been observed in recent years. The origin of FRBs is currently
unknown and many instruments are being built to detect more of these bursts to
better characterize their physical properties and identify the source
population. ALFABURST is one such instrument. ALFABURST takes advantage of the
7-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver on the 305-m Arecibo Radio
Telescope in Puerto Rico, to detect FRBs in real-time at L-band (1.4 GHz). We
present the results of recent on-sky tests and observations undertaken during
the commissioning phase of the instrument. ALFABURST is now available for
commensal observations with other ALFA projects.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense, millisecond-duration broadband radio
transients, the emission mechanisms of which are not understood. Masui et al.
recently presented Green Bank Telescope observations of FRB 110523, which
displayed temporal variation of the linear polarisation position angle (PA).
This effect is commonly seen in radio pulsars and is attributed to a changing
projected magnetic field orientation in the emission region as the star
rotates. If a neutron star is the progenitor of this FRB, and the emission
mechanism is pulsar-like, we show that the progenitor is either rapidly
rotating, or the emission originates from a region of complex magnetic field
geometry. The observed PA variation could also be caused by propagation effects
within a neutron-star magnetosphere, or by spatially varying magnetic fields if
the progenitor lies in a dense, highly magnetised environment. Although we urge
caution in generalising results from FRB 110523 to the broader FRB population,
our analysis serves as a guide to interpreting future polarisation measurements
of FRBs, and presents another means of elucidating the origins of these
enigmatic ephemera.

High time resolution radio surveys over the last few years have discovered a
population of millisecond-duration transient bursts called Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs), which remain of unknown origin. FRBs exhibit dispersion consistent with
propagation through a cold plasma and dispersion measures indicative of an
origin at cosmological distances. In this paper we perform Monte Carlo
simulations of a cosmological population of FRBs, based on assumptions
consistent with observations of their energy distribution, their spatial
density as a function of redshift and the properties of the interstellar and
intergalactic media. We examine whether the dispersion measures, fluences,
inferred redshifts, signal-to-noises and effective widths of known FRBs are
consistent with a cosmological population. Statistical analyses indicate that
at least 50 events at Parkes are required to distinguish between a constant
co-moving FRB density, and a FRB density that evolves with redshift like the
cosmological star formation rate density.

We report the first radio interferometric search at 843 MHz for fast
transients, particularly Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The recently recommissioned
Swinburne University of Technology's digital backend for the Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Telescope array (the UTMOST) with its large collecting
area (18,000 $\mathrm{m^2}$) and wide instantaneous field of view (7.80
$\mathrm{deg^2}$) is expected to be an efficient tool to detect FRBs. As an
interferometer it will be capable of discerning whether the FRBs are truly a
celestial population. We show that UTMOST at full design sensitivity can detect
an event approximately every few days. We report on 2 preliminary FRB surveys
at about 7% and 14% respectively of the array's final sensitivity. Several
pulsars have been detected via single pulses and no FRBs were discovered with
pulse widths ($W$), in the range 655.36 $\mu$s $< W < 41.9$ ms and dispersion
measures (DMs) in the range $100 < $DM$< 2000$ $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. This
non-detection sets a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of the sky rate of not more than
1000 events $\mathrm{sky^{-1}}$ $\mathrm{day^{-1}}$ at 843 MHz down to a flux
limit of 11 Jy for 1 ms FRBs. We show that this limit is consistent with
previous survey limits at 1.4 GHz and 145 MHz and set a lower limit on the mean
spectral index of FRBs of $\alpha > -3.2$.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05410v1
Assuming that Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are of extragalactic origin, we have
developed a formalism to predict the FRB detection rate and the redshift
distribution of the detected events for a telescope with given parameters. We
have adopted FRB 110220, for which the emitted pulse energy is estimated to be
$E_0 = 5.4 \times 10^{33}J$, as the reference event. The formalism requires us
to assume models for (1) pulse broadening due to scattering in the ionized
inter-galactic medium - we consider two different models for this, (2) the
frequency spectrum of the emitted pulse - we consider a power law model
$E_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $-5 \leq \alpha \leq 5$, and (3) the
comoving number density of the FRB occurrence rate $n(E,w_i,z)$ - we ignore the
z dependence and assume a fixed intrinsic pulse width $w_i = 1$ms for all the
FRBs. The distribution of the emitted pulse energy $E$ is modelled through (a)
a delta-function where all the FRBs have the same energy $E = E_0$ , and (b) a
Schechter luminosity function where the energies have a spread around $E_0$.
The models are all normalized using the 4 FRBs detected by Thornton et al.
(2013). Our model predictions for the Parkes telescope are all consistent with
the inferred redshift distribution of the fourteen FRBs detected there to date.
We also find that scattering places an upper limit on the redshift of the FRBs
detectable by a given telescope; for the Parkes telescope this is $z \sim 2$.
Considering the upcoming Ooty Wide Field Array, we predict a FRB detection rate
of $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 10^3$ per day.

The widths, dispersion measures, dispersion indices and fluences of Fast
Radio Bursts (FRB) impose coupled constraints that all models must satisfy.
Observation of dispersion indices close to their low density limit of $-2$ sets
a model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound on
the size of any dispersive plasma cloud. The non-monotonic dependence of burst
widths (after deconvolution of instrumental effects) on dispersion measure
excludes the intergalactic medium as the location of scattering that broadens
the FRB in time. Temporal broadening far greater than that of pulsars at
similar high Galactic latitudes implies that scattering occurs close to the
sources, where high densities and strong turbulence are plausible. FRB
energetics are consistent with supergiant pulses from young, fast, high-field
pulsars at cosmological distances. The distribution of FRB dispersion measures
is inconsistent with expanding clouds (such as SNR). It excludes space-limited
distributions (such as the local supercluster), but agrees with a homogeneous
cosmological distribution with intergalactic dispersion. The FRB
$\log{N}$--$\log{S}$ relation also indicates a cosmological distribution, aside
from the anomalously bright Lorimer burst.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04051v1
We discuss some of the claims that have been made regarding the statistics of
fast radio bursts (FRBs). In an earlier paper \citep{2015arXiv150505535C} we
conjectured that flicker noise associated with FRB repetition could show up in
non-cataclysmic neutron star emission models, like supergiant pulses. We show
how the current limits of repetition would be significantly weakened if their
repeat rate really were non-Poissonian and had a pink or red spectrum.
Repetition and its statistics have implications for observing strategy,
generally favouring shallow wide-field surveys, since in the non-repeating
scenario survey depth is unimportant. We also discuss the statistics of the
apparent latitudinal dependence of FRBs, and offer a simple method for
calculating the significance of this effect. We provide a generalized Bayesian
framework for addressing this problem, which allows for direct model
comparison. It is shown how the evidence for a steep latitudinal gradient of
the FRB rate is less strong than initially suggested and simple explanations
like increased scattering and sky temperature in the plane are sufficient to
decrease the low-latitude burst rate, given current data. The reported dearth
of bursts near the plane is further complicated if FRBs have non-Poissonian
repetition, since in that case the event rate inferred from observation depends
on observing strategy.

Aims: Recently, cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been used to
provide the most stringent limit up to date on Einstein's Equivalence Principle
(EEP). We study how to further test EEP with FRBs. Methods: Future systematic
radio surveys will certainly find abundant FRBs at cosmological distances and
some of them will inevitably be located behind clusters of galaxies. Here we
suggest to use those FRBs to further test EEP. Results: We find that the
robustness and accuracy of testing EEP can be improved further by orders of
magnitude with these FRBs. The same methodology can also be applied to any
other types of fast and bright transients at cosmological distances.

Here we present a catalogue of known Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources in the
form of an online catalogue, FRBCAT. The catalogue includes information about
the instrumentation used for the observations for each detected burst, the
measured quantities from each observation, and model-dependent quantities
derived from observed quantities. To aid in consistent comparisons of burst
properties such as width and signal-to-noise ratios we have reprocessed all the
bursts for which we have access to the raw data, with software which we make
available. The originally derived properties are also listed for comparison.
The catalogue is hosted online as a MySQL database which can also be downloaded
in tabular or plain text format for off-line use. This database will be
maintained for use by the community for studies of the FRB population as it
grows.

FRBs are puzzling, millisecond, energetic radio transients with no
discernible source; observations show no counterparts in other frequency bands.
The birth of a quark star from a parent neutron star experiencing a quark nova
- previously thought undetectable when born in isolation - provides a natural
explanation for the emission characteristics of FRBs. The generation of
unstable r-process elements in the quark nova ejecta provides millisecond
exponential injection of electrons into the surrounding strong magnetic field
at the parent neutron star's light cylinder via $\beta$-decay. This radio
synchrotron emission has a total duration of hundreds of milliseconds and
matches the observed spectrum while reducing the inferred dispersion measure by
approximately 200 cm$^{-3}$ pc. The model allows indirect measurement of
neutron star magnetic fields and periods in addition to providing astronomical
measurements of $\beta$-decay chains of unstable neutron rich nuclei. Using
this model, we can calculate expected FRB average energies ($\sim$ 10$^{41}$
ergs), spectra shapes and provide a theoretical framework for determining
distances.

The recently discovered fast radio bursts (FRBs), presumably of
extra-galactic origin, have the potential to become a powerful probe of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). We point out a few such potential applications. We
provide expressions for the dispersion measure and rotation measure as a
function of redshift, and we discuss the sensitivity of these measures to the
HeII reionization and the IGM magnetic field. Finally we calculate the
microlensing effect from an isolate, extragalctic stellar-mass compact object
on the FRB spectrum. The time delays between the two lensing images will induce
constructive and destructive interference, leaving a specific imprint on the
spectra of FRBs. With a high all-sky rate, a large statistical sample of FRBs
is expected to make these applications feasible.

The accuracy of Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) can be tested with the
observed time delays between correlated particles or photons that are emitted
from astronomical sources. Assuming as a lower limit that the time delays are
caused mainly by the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we prove that
fast radio bursts (FRBs) of cosmological origin can be used to constrain the
EEP with high accuracy. Taking FRB 110220 and two possible FRB/gamma-ray burst
(GRB) association systems (FRB/GRB 101011A and FRB/GRB 100704A) as examples, we
obtain a strict upper limit on the differences of the parametrized
post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ values as low as $\left[\gamma(1.23\; \rm
GHz)-\gamma(1.45\; \rm GHz)\right]<4.36\times10^{-9}$. This provides the most
stringent limit up to date on the EEP through the relative differential
variations of the $\gamma$ parameter at radio energies, improving by 1 to 2
orders of magnitude the previous results at other energies based on supernova
1987A and GRBs.

We have proposed a model of a progenitor of fast radio bursts (FRBs): The
FRBs are emitted by electrons in atmospheres of neutron stars when neutron
stars collide with dark matter axion stars. We reexamine the model by taking
account of the tidal forces of the neutron stars. The axion stars are distorted
by the forces so that they become like long sticks when they are close to the
neutron stars. Although the tidal forces fairly distort the axion stars, our
model is still consistent with present observations. We explain a distinctive
feature of our model that the FRBs are not broadband, but narrowband. We also
show that two-component FRBs may arise when the axion stars collide with binary
neutron stars. FRBs would most frequently arise in centers of galaxies since
the dark matter concentrates in the centers.

Fast Radio Bursts are bright, unresolved, non-repeating, broadband,
millisecond flashes, found primarily at high Galactic latitudes, with
dispersion measures much larger than expected for a Galactic source. The
inferred all-sky burst rate is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate
out to redshift 0.5. If the observed dispersion measures are assumed to be
dominated by the intergalactic medium, the sources are at cosmological
distances with redshifts of 0.2 to 1. These parameters are consistent with a
wide range of source models. One fast radio burst showed circular polarization
[21(7)%] of the radio emission, but no linear polarization was detected, and
hence no Faraday rotation measure could be determined. Here we report the
examination of archival data revealing Faraday rotation in a newly detected
burst - FRB 110523. It has radio flux at least 0.6 Jy and dispersion measure
623.30(5) pc cm$^{-3}$. Using Galactic contribution 45 pc cm$^{-3}$ and a model
of intergalactic electron density, we place the source at a maximum redshift of
0.5. The burst has rotation measure -186.1(1.4) rad m$^{-2}$, much higher than
expected for this line of sight through the Milky Way and the intergalactic
medium, indicating magnetization in the vicinity of the source itself or within
a host galaxy. The pulse was scattered by two distinct plasma screens during
propagation, which requires either a dense nebula associated with the source or
a location within the central region of its host galaxy. Keeping in mind that
there may be more than one type of fast radio burst source, the detection in
this instance of source-local magnetization and scattering favours models
involving young stellar populations such as magnetars over models involving the
mergers of older neutron stars, which are more likely to be located in low
density regions of the host galaxy.

The nature of fast radio bursts (FRB) has been extensively debated. Here we
investigate FRB121102, detected at Arecibo telescope and remarkable for its
unusually large spectral index. After extensive study we conclude that the
spectral index is caused by a nebula with free-free absorption. We find that
putative nebula must lie beyond the Milky Way. We conclude that FRBs are of
extra-galactic origin and that they arise in dense star-forming regions. The
challenge with extra-galactic models is the the high volumetric rate of FRBs.
This high rate allows us to eliminate all models of catastrophic stellar
deaths. Hyper-giant flares from young magnetars emerge as the most likely
progenitors. Some of the consequences are: (i) Intergalactic FRB models can be
safely ignored. (ii) The rich ISM environment of young magnetars can result in
significant contribution to DM, Rotation Measure (RM) and in some cases to
significant free-free optical depth. (iii) The star-forming regions in the host
galaxies can contribute significantly to the DM. Including this contribution
reduces the inferred distances to FRBs and correspondingly increases the
volumetric rate of FRBs (and, in turn, may require that giant flares can also
produce FRBs). (iv) FRBs are likely to be suppressed at lower frequencies.
Conversely, searching for FRBs at higher frequencies (2-5 GHz) would be
attractive. (v) The blast wave which produces the radio emission can undergo
rapid deceleration if the circum-burst medium is dense (as maybe the case for
FRB121102), leading to X-ray, radio and possibly gamma-ray emission. (vi)
Galaxies with high star formation rate host will have a higher FRB rate.
However, such FRBs will have differing DMs owing to differing local
contributions. (vi) The DM and RM of FRBs will prove to be noisy probes of the
intergalactic medium (density, magnetic field) and cosmography.

The detection of five new fast radio bursts (FRBs) found in the High Time
Resolution Universe high latitude survey is presented. The rate implied is
6$^{+4}_{-3}\times~10^3$ (95%) FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence of
between 0.13 and 5.9 Jy ms for FRBs between 0.128 and 262 ms in duration. One
of these FRBs has a clear two-component profile, each component is similar to
the known population of single component FRBs and are separated by 2.4(4) ms.
All the FRB components appear to be unresolved following deconvolution with a
scattering tail and accounting for intra-channel smearing. The two-component
FRB also has the highest dispersion measure (1629 pc cm$^{-3}$) of any FRB
to-date. Many of the proposed models to explain FRBs use a single high energy
event involving compact objects (such as neutron star mergers) and therefore
cannot easily explain a two-component FRB. Models that are based on extreme
versions of flaring, pulsing or orbital events however could produce multiple
component profiles. The compatibility of these models and the FRB rate implied
by these detections is discussed.

Axions are one of the most promising candidates of dark matter. The axions
have been shown to form miniclusters with masses $\sim 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ and
to become dominant component of dark matter. Some of the axion miniclusters
condense to form axion stars. We have recently shown a possible origin of fast
radio bursts ( FRBs ) by assuming that the axion stars are main component of
halos: FRBs arise from the collisions between the axion stars and neutron
stars. It is remarkable that the masses of the axion stars obtained by the
comparison of the theoretical and observational event rates are coincident with
the mass $\sim 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. In this paper, we describe our model of FRBs
in detail. We derive the approximate solutions of the axion stars with large
radii and constraint their masses for the approximation to be valid. The FRBs
are emitted by electrons in atmospheres of neutron stars. By calculating the
optical depth of the atmospheres, we show that they are transparent for the
radiations with the frequency given by the axion mass $m_a$ such as
$m_a/2\pi\simeq 2.4$GHz$(m_a/10^{-5}\rm eV)$. Although the radiations are
linearly polarized when they are emitted, they are shown to be circularly
polarized after they pass magnetospheres of neutron stars. We also show that
the FRBs are not broadband and their frequencies have finite bandwidths owing
to the thermal fluctuations of the electrons in the atmospheres of the neutron
stars. The presence of the finite bandwidths is a distinctive feature of our
model and can be tested observationally. Furthermore, we show that similar FRBs
may arise when the axion stars collide with magnetic white dwarfs $B\sim
10^9$G. The distinctive feature is that the durations of the bursts are of the
order of $0.1$second.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) constitute an emerging class of fast radio transient
whose origin continues to be a mystery. Realizing the importance of increasing
coverage of the search parameter space, we have designed, built, and deployed a
realtime monitor for FRBs at the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope. Named
'ALFABURST', it is a commensal instrument that is triggered whenever the 1.4
GHz seven-beam Arecibo $L$-Band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver commences operation.
The ongoing commensal survey we are conducting using ALFABURST has an
instantaneous field of view of 0.02 sq. deg. within the FWHM of the beams, with
the realtime software configurable to use up to 300 MHz of bandwidth. We search
for FRBs with dispersion measure up to 2560 cm$^{-3}$ pc and pulse widths
ranging from 0.128 ms to 16.384 ms. Commissioning observations performed over
the past few months have demonstrated the capability of the instrument in
detecting single pulses from known pulsars. In this paper, I describe the
instrument and the associated survey.

We present the results of a pilot study search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) at low frequencies (139 - 170 MHz).
We utilised MWA data obtained in a routine imaging mode from observations where
the primary target was a field being studied for Epoch of Reionisation
detection. We formed images with 2 second time resolution and 1.28~MHz
frequency resolution for 10.5 hours of observations, over 400 square degrees of
the sky. We de-dispersed the dynamic spectrum in each of 372,100 resolution
elements of 2$\times$2 arcmin$^{2}$, between dispersion measures of 170 and
675~pc~cm$^{-3}$. Based on the event rate calculations in Trott, Tingay & Wayth
(2013), which assumes a standard candle luminosity of $8\times10^{37}$
Js$^{-1}$, we predict that with this choice of observational parameters, the
MWA should detect ($\sim10$,$\sim2$,$\sim0$) FRBs with spectral indices
corresponding to ($-$2, $-$1, 0), based on a 7$\sigma$ detection threshold. We
find no FRB candidates above this threshold from our search, placing an event
rate limit of $<700$ above 700 Jy.ms per day per sky and providing evidence
against spectral indices $\alpha<-1.2$ ($S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). We compare our
event rate and spectral index limits with others from the literature. We
briefly discuss these limits in light of recent suggestions that supergiant
pulses from young neutron stars could explain FRBs. We find that such
supergiant pulses would have to have much flatter spectra between 150 and 1400
MHz than have been observed from Crab giant pulses to be consistent with the
FRB spectral index limit we derive.

Most black holes (BHs) will absorb a neutron star (NS) companion fully
intact, without tidal disruption, suggesting the pair will remain dark to
telescopes. Even without tidal disruption, electromagnetic luminosity is
generated from the battery phase of the binary when the BH interacts with the
NS magnetic field. Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays
or gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted
in the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of
fast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence
rates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the
transients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a
precursor. The rapid ramp-up in luminosity manifests as a precursor to the
burst which is $20\%-80\%$ as luminous, given 0.5~ms timing resolution. The
main burst is from the peak luminosity before merger. The post-merger burst
follows from the NS magnetic field migration to the BH, causing a shock. NS--BH
pairs are especially desirable for ground-based gravitational wave (GW)
observatories since the pair might not otherwise be detected, with
electromagnetic counterparts greatly augmenting the scientific leverage beyond
the GW signal. Valuably, the electromagnetic signal can break degeneracies in
the parameters encoded in the GW as well as probe the NS magnetic field
strength, yielding insights into open problems in NS magnetic field decay.

In the last few years ARCADE 2, combined with older experiments, has detected
an additional radio background, measured as a temperature and ranging in
frequency from 22 MHz to 10 GHz, not accounted for by known radio sources and
the cosmic microwave background. One type of source which has not been
considered in the radio background is that of fast transients (those with event
times much less than the observing time). We present a simple estimate, and a
more detailed calculation, for the contribution of radio transients to the
diffuse background. As a timely example, we estimate the contribution from the
recently-discovered fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although their contribution is
likely 6 or 7 orders of magnitude too small (though there are large
uncertainties in FRB parameters) to account for the ARCADE~2 excess, our
development is general and so can be applied to any fast transient sources,
discovered or yet to be discovered. We estimate parameter values necessary for
transient sources to noticeably contribute to the radio background.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00834v2
Discoveries of rotating radio transients and fast radio bursts (FRBs) in
pulsar surveys suggest that more of such transient sources await discovery in
archival data sets. Here we report on a single-pulse search for dispersed radio
bursts over a wide range of Galactic latitudes (|b| < $60^{\circ}$) in data
previously searched for periodic sources by Burgay et al. We re-detected 20 of
the 42 pulsars reported by Burgay et al. and one rotating radio transient
reported by Burke-Spolaor. No FRBs were discovered in this survey. Taking into
account this result, and other recent surveys at Parkes, we corrected for
detection sensitivities based on the search software used in the analyses and
the different backends used in these surveys and find that the all-sky FRB
event rate for sources with a fluence above 4.0 Jy ms at 1.4 GHz to be ${\cal
R} = 4.4^{+5.2}_{-3.1} \times 10^3$ FRBs day$^{-1}$ sky$^{-1}$, where the
uncertainties represent a $99\%$ confidence interval. While this rate is lower
than inferred from previous studies, as we demonstrate, this combined event
rate is consistent with the results of all systematic FRB searches at Parkes to
date and does not require the need to postulate a dearth of FRBs at
intermediate latitudes.

We propose that "standard pings", brief broadband radio impulses, can be used
to study the three-dimensional clustering of matter in the Universe even in the
absence of redshift information. The dispersion of radio waves as they travel
through the intervening plasma can, like redshift, be used as a cosmological
distance measure. Because of inhomogeneities in the electron density along the
line of sight, dispersion is an imperfect proxy for radial distance and we show
that this leads to calculable dispersion-space distortions in the apparent
clustering of sources. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a new class of radio
transients that are the prototypical standard ping and, due to their high
observed dispersion, have been interpreted as originating at cosmological
distances. The rate of fast radio bursts has been estimated to be several
thousand over the whole sky per day and, if cosmological, the sources of these
events should trace the large-scale structure of the Universe. We calculate the
dispersion-space power spectra for a simple model where electrons and FRBs are
biased tracers of the large-scale structure of the Universe and we show that
the clustering signal could be measured using as few as 10 000 events. Such a
survey is in line with what may be achieved with upcoming wide-field radio
telescopes.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05535v3
We propose a new extragalactic but non-cosmological explanation for fast
radio bursts (FRBs) based on very young pulsars in supernova remnants. Within a
few hundred years of a core-collapse supernova the ejecta is confined within
$\sim$1 pc, providing a high enough column density of free electrons for the
observed 375-1600 pc cm$^{-3}$ of dispersion measure (DM). By extrapolating a
Crab-like pulsar to its infancy in an environment like that of SN 1987A, we
hypothesize such an object could emit supergiant pulses sporadically which
would be bright enough to be seen at a few hundred megaparsecs. We hypothesize
that such supergiant pulses would preferentially occur early in the pulsar's
life when the free electron density is still high, which is why we do not see
large numbers of moderate DM FRBs ($\lesssim300$ pc cm$^{-3}$). In this
scenario Faraday rotation at the source gives rotation measures (RMs) much
larger than the expected cosmological contribution. If the emission were
pulsar-like, then the polarization vector could swing over the duration of the
burst, which is not expected from non-rotating objects. In this model, the
scattering, large DM, and commensurate RM all come from one place which is not
the case for the cosmological interpretation. The model also provides testable
predictions of the flux distribution and repeat rate of FRBs, and could be
further verified by spatial coincidence with optical supernovae of the past
several decades and cross-correlation with nearby galaxy maps.

Based on fundamental particle physics processes like the production and
subsequent decay of pions in interactions of high-energy particles, close
connections exist between the acceleration sites of high-energy cosmic rays and
the emission of high-energy gamma rays and high-energy neutrinos. In most cases
these connections provide both spatial and temporal correlations of the
different emitted particles. The combination of the complementary information
provided by these messengers allows to lift ambiguities in the interpretation
of the data and enables novel and highly sensitive analyses. In this
contribution the H.E.S.S. multi-messenger program is introduced and described.
The current core of this newly installed program is the combination of
high-energy neutrinos and high-energy gamma rays. The search for gamma-ray
emission following gravitational wave triggers is also discussed. Furthermore,
the existing program for following triggers in the electromagnetic regime was
extended by the search for gamma-ray emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). An
overview over current and planned analyses is given and recent results are
presented.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01002v3
There are by now ten published detections of fast radio bursts (FRBs), single
bright GHz-band millisecond pulses of unknown origin. Proposed explanations
cover a broad range from exotic processes at cosmological distances to
atmospheric and terrestrial sources. Loeb et al. have previously suggested that
FRB sources could be nearby flare stars, and pointed out the presence of a
W-UMa-type contact binary within the beam of one out of three FRB fields that
they examined. Using time-domain optical photometry and spectroscopy, we now
find possible flare stars in additional FRB fields, with one to three such
cases among eight FRB fields studied. We evaluate the chance probabilities of
these possible associations to be in the range 0.1% to 9%, depending on the
input assumptions. Further, we re-analyze the probability that two FRBs
recently discovered 3 years apart within the same radio beam are unrelated.
Contrary to other claims, we conclude with 99% confidence that the two events
are from the same repeating source. The different dispersion measures between
the two bursts then rule out a cosmological origin for the dispersion measure,
but are consistent with the flare-star scenario with a varying plasma blanket
between bursts. Finally, we review some theoretical objections that have been
raised against a local flare-star FRB origin, and show that they are incorrect.

Several theories exist to explain the source of the bright, millisecond
duration pulses known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). If the progenitors of FRBs
are non-cataclysmic, such as giant pulses from pulsars, pulsar-planet binaries,
or magnetar flares, FRB emission may be seen to repeat. We have undertaken a
survey of the fields of eight known FRBs from the High Time Resolution Universe
survey to search for repeating pulses. Although no repeat pulses were detected
the survey yielded the detection of a new FRB, described in Petroff et al.
(2015a). From our observations we rule out periodic repeating sources with
periods P $\leq$ 8.6 hours and rule out sources with periods 8.6 < P < 21 hours
at the 90% confidence level. At P $\geq$ 21 hours our limits fall off as ~1/P.
Dedicated and persistent observations of FRB source fields are needed to rule
out repetition on longer timescales, a task well-suited to next generation
wide-field transient detectors.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are newly discovered radio transient sources. Their
high dispersion measures indicate an extragalactic origin. But due to the lack
of observational data in other wavelengths, their progenitors still remain
unclear. Here we suggest the collisions between neutron stars and
asteroids/comets as a promising mechanism for FRBs. During the impact process,
a hot plasma fireball will form after the material of the small body penetrates
into the neutron star surface. The ionized matter inside the fireball will then
expand along the magnetic field lines. Coherent radiation from the thin shell
at the top of the fireball will account for the observed FRBs. Our scenario can
reasonably explain the main features of FRBs, such as their durations,
luminosities, and the event rate. We argue that for a single neutron star, FRBs
are not likely to happen repeatedly in a forseeable time span since such
impacts are of low probability. We predict that faint remnant X-ray emissions
should be associated with FRBs, but it may be too faint to be detected by
detectors at work.

We estimate the energy reservoir available in the deconfinement phase
transition induced collapse of a neutron star to its hybrid star mass twin on
the "third family" branch, using a recent equation of state of dense matter.
The available energy corresponding to the mass-energy difference between
configurations is comparable with energies of the most violent astrophysical
burst processes. An observational outcome of such a dynamical transition might
be fast radio bursts, specifically a recent example of a FRB with a double-peak
structure in its light curve.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are millisecond radio signals that exhibit
dispersion larger than what the Galactic electron density can account for. We
have conducted a 1446 hour survey for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at 145~MHz,
covering a total of 4193 sq. deg on the sky. We used the UK station of the
LOFAR radio telescope -- the Rawlings Array -- , accompanied for a majority of
the time by the LOFAR station at Nan\c{c}ay, observing the same fields at the
same frequency. Our real-time search backend, ARTEMIS, utilizes graphics
processing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320
cm$^{-3}$ pc. Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4~GHz, and
favoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous
detections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs
above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper
limit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$
for 5~ms-duration pulses above 62~Jy. The non-detection could be due to
scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape
of FRB flux density spectra. Assuming the latter and that FRBs are standard
candles, the non-detection is compatible with the published FRB sky rate, if
their spectra follow a power law with frequency ($\propto \nu^{\alpha}$), with
$\alpha\gtrsim+0.1$, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. Our
results suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequency
component of the Square Kilometre Array, will have better chances to detect,
estimate rates and understand the origin and properties of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4829v2
We present constraints on the origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) using large
cosmological simulations. We calculate contributions to FRB dispersion measures
(DMs) from the Milky Way, from the local Universe, from cosmological
large-scale structure, and from potential FRB host galaxies, and then compare
these simulations to the DMs of observed FRBs. We find that the Milky Way
contribution has previously been underestimated by a factor of ~2, and that the
foreground-subtracted DMs are consistent with a cosmological origin,
corresponding to a source population observable to a maximum redshift
z~0.6-0.9. We consider models for the spatial distribution of FRBs in which
they are randomly distributed in the Universe, track the star-formation rate of
their host galaxies, track total stellar mass, or require a central
supermassive black hole. Current data do not discriminate between these
possibilities, but the predicted DM distributions for different models will
differ considerably once we begin detecting FRBs at higher DMs and higher
redshifts. We additionally consider the distribution of FRB fluences, and show
that the observations are consistent with FRBs being standard candles, each
burst producing the same radiated isotropic energy. The data imply a constant
isotropic burst energy of ~7e40 erg if FRBs are embedded in host galaxies, or
~9e40 erg if FRBs are randomly distributed. These energies are 10-100 times
larger than had previously been inferred. Within the constraints of the
available small sample of data, our analysis favours FRB mechanisms for which
the isotropic radiated energy has a narrow distribution in excess of 1e40 erg.

We examine the effect of Galactic diffractive interstellar scintillation as a
means of explaining the reported deficit of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) detections
at low Galactic latitude. We model the unknown underlying FRB flux density
distribution as a power law with a rate scaling as $S_\nu^{-5/2+\delta}$ and
account for the fact that the FRBs are detected at unknown positions within the
telescope beam. We find that the event rate of FRBs located off the Galactic
plane may be enhanced by a factor ~30-300% relative to objects near the
Galactic plane without necessarily affecting the slope of the distribution. For
FRBs whose flux densities are subject to relatively weak diffractive
scintillation, as is typical for events detected at high Galactic latitudes, we
demonstrate that an effect associated with Eddington bias is responsible for
the enhancement. The magnitude of the enhancement increases with the steepness
of the underlying flux density distribution, so that existing limits on the
disparity in event rates between high and low Galactic latitudes suggest that
the FRB population has a steep differential flux density distribution, scaling
as $S_\nu^{-3.5}$ or steeper. Existing estimates of the event rate in the flux
density range probed by the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey
overestimate the true rate by a factor of ~3.

We synthesize the known information about Fast Radio Bursts and radio
magnetars, and describe an allowed origin near nuclei of external, but
non-cosmological, galaxies. This places them at $z\ll1$, within a few hundred
megaparsecs. In this scenario, the high DM is dominated by the environment of
the FRB, modelled on the known properties of the Milky Way Center, whose
innermost 100pc provides 1000 pc/cm$^3$. A radio loud magnetar is known to
exist in our galactic center, within $\sim$2 arc seconds of Sgr A*. Based on
the polarization, DM, and scattering properties of this known magnetar, we
extrapolate its properties to those of Crab-like giant pulses and SGR flares
and point out their consistency with observed Fast Radio Bursts. We conclude
galactic center magnetars could be the source of FRB's. This scenario is
readily testable with VLBI measurements as well as with flux count statistics
from large surveys such as CHIME or UTMOST.

If Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are truly at astronomical, in particular
cosmological, distances, they represent one of the most exciting discoveries in
astrophysics of the past decade. However, the distance to FRBs has, to date,
been estimated purely from their excess dispersion, and has not been
corroborated by any independent means. In this paper we discuss the possibility
of detecting neutral hydrogen absorption against FRBs both from spiral arms
within our own galaxy, or from intervening extragalactic HI clouds. In either
case a firm lower limit on the distance to the FRB would be established.
Absorption against galactic spiral arms may already be detectable for bright
low-latitude bursts with existing facilities, and should certainly be so by the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Absorption against extragalactic HI clouds, which
would confirm the cosmological distances of FRBs, should also be detectable
with the SKA, and maybe also Arecibo. Quantitatively, we estimate that SKA1-MID
should be able to detect extragalactic HI absorption against a few percent of
FRBs at a redshift z~1.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an emerging class of short and bright radio
transients whose sources remain enigmatic. Within the galactic center, the
non-detection of pulsars within the inner $\sim \!10\,{\rm pc}$ has created a
missing pulsar problem that has intensified with time. With all reserve, we
advance the notion that the two problems could be linked by a common solution:
the collapse of neutron stars (NS) due to capture and sedimentation of dark
matter (DM) within their cores. Bramante \& Linden (2014), Phys.\ Rev.\
Lett.~19, 191301 showed that certain DM properties allow for rapid NS collapse
within the high DM density environments near galactic centers while permitting
NS survival elsewhere. Each DM-induced collapse could generate an FRB as the NS
magnetosphere is suddenly expelled. This scenario could explain several
features of FRBs: their short time scales, large energies, locally produced
scattering tails, and high event rates. We predict that FRBs are localized to
galactic centers, and that our own galactic center harbors a large population
of NS-mass ($M\sim1.4 M_\odot$) black holes. The DM-induced collapse scenario
is intrinsically unlikely because it can only occur in a small region of
allowable DM parameter space. However, if observed to occur, it would place
tight constraints on DM properties.

In this paper we address the problem of performing statistical inference for
large scale data sets i.e., Big Data. The volume and dimensionality of the data
may be so high that it cannot be processed or stored in a single computing
node. We propose a scalable, statistically robust and computationally efficient
bootstrap method, compatible with distributed processing and storage systems.
Bootstrap resamples are constructed with smaller number of distinct data points
on multiple disjoint subsets of data, similarly to the bag of little bootstrap
method (BLB) [1]. Then significant savings in computation is achieved by
avoiding the re-computation of the estimator for each bootstrap sample.
Instead, a computationally efficient fixed-point estimation equation is
analytically solved via a smart approximation following the Fast and Robust
Bootstrap method (FRB) [2]. Our proposed bootstrap method facilitates the use
of highly robust statistical methods in analyzing large scale data sets. The
favorable statistical properties of the method are established analytically.
Numerical examples demonstrate scalability, low complexity and robust
statistical performance of the method in analyzing large data sets.

The on-going PALFA survey at the Arecibo Observatory began in 2004 and is
searching for radio pulsars in the Galactic plane at 1.4 GHz. Observations
since 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than were
previously employed in this survey. A new data reduction pipeline has been in
place since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,
searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as
well as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection
heuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8
millisecond pulsars (MSPs; P < 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery
totals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The
pipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars
including 60 found in PALFA data by re-analyzing observations previously
searched by other pipelines. A comprehensive description of the survey
sensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has been
determined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and
amplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered
with the data reduction pipeline. We have confirmed that the PALFA survey
achieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models. However, we
also find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used
there is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P >= 100 ms that
gradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for P > 4 s at DM < 150 pc/cc.
This degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. We
find that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to be
detected in the absence of red noise. This reduced sensitivity could have
implications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the Galaxy.

"Perytons" are millisecond-duration transients of terrestrial origin, whose
frequency-swept emission mimics the dispersion of an astrophysical pulse that
has propagated through tenuous cold plasma. In fact, their similarity to FRB
010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of "fast radio
bursts," which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. Until now, the
physical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. We
have identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3--2.5 GHz associated with
several peryton events. Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be
generated at 1.4 GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the
telescope is at an appropriate relative angle. Radio emission escaping from
microwave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of the
observed properties of the peryton signals. Now that the peryton source has
been identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site could
not have caused FRB 010724. This and other distinct observational differences
show that FRBs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients.

Fast Radios Bursts (FRBs) show large dispersion measures (DMs), suggesting an
extragalactic location. We analyze the DMs of the 11 known FRBs in detail and
identify steps as integer multiples of half the lowest DM found, 187.5cm$^{-3}$
pc, so that DMs occur in groups centered at 375, 562, 750, 937, 1125cm$^{-3}$
pc, with errors observed <5%. We estimate the likelhood of a coincidence as
5:10,000. We speculate that this could originate from a Galaxy population of
FRBs, with Milky Way DM contribution as model deviations, and an underlying
generator process that produces FRBs with DMs in discrete steps. However, we
find that FRBs tend to arrive at close to the full integer second, like
man-made perytons. If this holds, FRBs would also be man-made. This can be
verified, or refuted, with new FRBs to be detected.

The Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) using radio telescopes
is an area of research that is now more than 50 years old. Thus far, both
targeted and wide-area surveys have yet to detect artificial signals from
intelligent civilisations. In this paper, I argue that the incidence of
co-existing intelligent and communicating civilisations is probably small in
the Milky Way. While this makes successful SETI searches a very difficult
pursuit indeed, the huge impact of even a single detection requires us to
continue the search. A substantial increase in the overall performance of radio
telescopes (and in particular future wide-field instruments such as the Square
Kilometre Array, SKA), provide renewed optimism in the field. Evidence for this
is already to be seen in the success of SETI researchers in acquiring
observations on some of the world's most sensitive radio telescope facilities
via open, peer-reviewed processes. The increasing interest in the dynamic radio
sky, and our ability to detect new and rapid transient phenomena such as Fast
Radio Bursts (FRB) is also greatly encouraging. While the nature of FRBs is not
yet fully understood, I argue they are unlikely to be the signature of distant
extra-terrestrial civilisations. As astronomers face a data avalanche on all
sides, advances made in related areas such as advanced Big Data analytics, and
cognitive computing are crucial to enable serendipitous discoveries to be made.
In any case, as the era of the SKA fast approaches, the prospects of a SETI
detection have never have been better.

A new population of sources emitting fast and bright transient radio bursts
has recently been identified. The observed large dispersion measure values of
FRBs suggests an extragalactic origin and an accurate determination of their
positions and distances will provide an unique opportunity to study the
magneto-ionic properties of the IGM. So far, FRBs have all been found using
large dishes equipped with multi-pixel arrays. While large single dishes are
well-suited for the discovery of transient sources they are poor at providing
accurate localisations. A 2D snapshot image of the sky, made with a correlation
interferometer array, can provide an accurate localisation of many compact
radio sources simultaneously. However, the required time resolution to detect
FRBs and a desire to detect them in real time, makes this currently
impractical. In a beamforming approach, where many narrow tied-array beams are
produced, the advantages of single dishes and interferometers can be combined.
We present a proof-of-concept analysis of a new non-imaging method that
utilises the additional spectral and comparative spatial information obtained
from multiple overlapping TABs to estimate a transient source location with up
to arcsecond accuracy in almost real time. We show that this method can work
for a variety of interferometric configurations, including for LOFAR and
MeerKAT, and that the estimated angular position may be sufficient to identify
a host galaxy without reference to other simultaneous or follow-up
observations. With this method, many transient sources can be localised to
small fractions of a HPBW of a TAB, in the case of MeerKAT, sufficient to
localise a source to arcsecond accuracy. In cases where the position is less
accurately determined we can still significantly reduce the area that need be
searched for associated emission at other wavelengths and potential host
galaxies.

The science cases for incorporating high time resolution capabilities into
modern radio telescopes are as numerous as they are compelling. Science targets
range from exotic sources such as pulsars, to our Sun, to recently detected
possible extragalactic bursts of radio emission, the so-called fast radio
bursts (FRBs). Originally conceived purely as an imaging telescope, the initial
design of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) did not include the ability to
access high time and frequency resolution voltage data. However, the
flexibility of the MWA's software correlator allowed an off-the-shelf solution
for adding this capability. This paper describes the system that records the
100 micro-second and 10 kHz resolution voltage data from the MWA. Example
science applications, where this capability is critical, are presented, as well
as accompanying commissioning results from this mode to demonstrate
verification.

Impulsive radio bursts that are detectable across cosmological distances
constitute extremely powerful probes of the ionized Inter-Galactic Medium
(IGM), intergalactic magnetic fields, and the properties of space-time itself.
Their dispersion measures (DMs) will enable us to detect the "missing" baryons
in the low-redshift Universe and make the first measurements of the mean galaxy
halo profile, a key parameter in models of galaxy formation and feedback.
Impulsive bursts can be used as cosmic rulers at redshifts exceeding 2, and
constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$ at redshifts
beyond those readily accessible by Type Ia SNe. Both of these goals are
realisable with a sample of $\sim 10^4$ fast radio bursts (FRBs) whose
positions are localized to within one arcsecond, sufficient to obtain host
galaxy redshifts via optical follow-up. It is also hypothesised that
gravitational wave events may emit coherent emission at frequencies probed by
SKA1-LOW, and the localization of such events at cosmological distances would
enable their use as cosmological standard sirens.
  To perform this science, such bursts must be localized to their specific host
galaxies so that their redshifts may be obtained and compared against their
dispersion measures, rotation measures, and scattering properties. The SKA can
achieve this with a design that has a wide field-of-view, a substantial
fraction of its collecting area in a compact configuration (80\% within a 3\,km
radius), and a capacity to attach high-time-resolution instrumentation to its
signal path.

We report the real-time discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB 131104) with the
Parkes radio telescope in a targeted observation of the Carina dwarf spheroidal
galaxy. The dispersion measure of the burst is 779 cm$^{-3}$ pc, exceeding
predictions for the maximum line-of-sight Galactic contribution by a factor of
11. The temporal structure of the burst is characterized by an exponential
scattering tail with a timescale of 2.0$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ ms at 1582 MHz that
scales as frequency to the power $-$4.4$^{+1.6}_{-1.8}$ (all uncertainties
represent 95% confidence intervals). We bound the intrinsic pulse width to be
$<0.64$ ms due to dispersion smearing across a single spectrometer channel.
Searches in 78 hours of follow-up observations with the Parkes telescope reveal
no additional sporadic emission and no evidence for associated periodic radio
emission. We hypothesize that the burst is associated with the Carina dwarf
galaxy. Follow-up observations at other wavelengths are necessary to test this
hypothesis.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5766v2
The pulse widths, dispersion measures and dispersion indices of Fast Radio
Bursts (FRB) impose coupled constraints that all models must satisfy. We show
that if the dispersion measures resulted from propagation through the
intergalactic medium at cosmological distances and the pulse widths were a
consequence of scattering by single thin screens, then the screens' electron
densities were $\gtrsim 20$/cm$^3$, $10^8$ times the mean intergalactic
density. This problem is resolved if the radiation scattered close to its
source, where high densities are possible. Observation of dispersion indices
close to their low density limit of $-2$ sets a model-independent upper bound
on the electron density and a lower bound on the size of the dispersive plasma
cloud, excluding terrestrial or Solar System origin. The scattering and much of
the dispersion measures may be attributed to scattering regions about 1 AU from
the sources, with electron densities $\sim 3 \times 10^8$/cm$^3$. The inferred
parameters are only marginally consistent; re-examination of the assumed
relation between dispersion measure and distance is warranted. Origin in an
ionized starburst or protogalaxy is suggested, but statistical arguments
exclude compact young SNR in the Galactic neighborhood. An appendix applies
these arguments to PSR J1745-2900 at the Galactic Center. We suggest that its
pulse width and angular broadening may be reconciled if we are near a caustic
or focal point produced by refraction, rather than by the classic thin sheet
scattering model.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7536v1
We report on the first millisecond timescale radio interferometric search for
the new class of transient known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). We used the Very
Large Array (VLA) for a 166-hour, millisecond imaging campaign to detect and
precisely localize an FRB. We observed at 1.4 GHz and produced visibilities
with 5 ms time resolution over 256 MHz of bandwidth. Dedispersed images were
searched for transients with dispersion measures from 0 to 3000 pc/cm3. No
transients were detected in observations of high Galactic latitude fields taken
from September 2013 though October 2014. Observations of a known pulsar show
that images typically had a thermal-noise limited sensitivity of 120 mJy/beam
(8 sigma; Stokes I) in 5 ms and could detect and localize transients over a
wide field of view. Our nondetection limits the FRB rate to less than
7e4/sky/day (95% confidence) above a fluence limit of 1.2 Jy-ms. Assuming a
Euclidean flux distribution, the VLA rate limit is inconsistent with the
published rate of Thornton et al. We recalculate previously published rates
with a homogeneous consideration of the effects of primary beam attenuation,
dispersion, pulse width, and sky brightness. This revises the FRB rate downward
and shows that the VLA observations had a roughly 60% chance of detecting a
typical FRB and that a 95% confidence constraint would require roughly 500
hours of similar VLA observing. Our survey also limits the repetition rate of
an FRB to 2 times less than any known repeating millisecond radio transient.

In this paper we identify some sub-optimal performance in algorithms that
search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), which can reduce the cosmological volume
probed by over 20%, and result in missed discoveries and incorrect flux density
and sky rate determinations. Re-calculating parameters for all of the FRBs
discovered with the Parkes telescope (i.e. all of the reported FRBs bar one),
we find some inconsistencies with previously determined values, e.g. FRB 010125
was approximately twice as bright as previously reported. We describe some
incompleteness factors not previously considered which are important in
determining accurate population statistics, e.g. accounting for fluence
incompleteness the Thornton et al. all-sky rate can be re-phrased as ~2500 FRBs
per sky per day above a 1.4-GHz fluence of ~2 Jy ms. Finally we make data for
the FRBs easily available, along with software to analyse these.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of the
radio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapid
multiwavelength follow-up of an FRB has been possible. New instrumentation has
decreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and
enables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have
discovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 14 May, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 UTC
at the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths
within hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM)
of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z
\lesssim 0.5$. FRB 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularly
polarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linear
polarization $<10%$. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the
FRB. If there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected from
coherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by Faraday rotation caused
by passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. FRB
140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known FRB fields, and
lies close to a previous discovery, FRB 110220; based on the difference in DMs
of these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity to
sampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. Follow-up conducted
by 12 telescopes observing from X-ray to radio wavelengths was unable to
identify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out models
in which FRBs originate from nearby ($z < 0.3$) supernovae and long duration
gamma-ray bursts.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5637v2
The existence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), a new type of extragalatic
transients, has been established recently and quite a few models have been
proposed. In this work we discuss the possible connection between the FRB
sources and ultra-high energy ($>10^{18}$ eV) cosmic rays. We show that in the
blitzar model and the model of merging binary neutron stars, the huge energy
release of each FRB central engine together with the rather high rate of FRBs,
the accelerated EeV cosmic rays may contribute significantly to the observed
ones. In other FRB models including for example the merger of double white
dwarfs and the energetic magnetar radio flares, no significant EeV cosmic ray
is expected. We also suggest that the mergers of double neutron stars, even if
they are irrelevant to FRBs, may play a non-ignorable role in producing EeV
cosmic ray protons if supramassive neutron stars were formed in a good fraction
of mergers and the merger rate is $\gtrsim 10^{3}~{\rm yr^{-1}~ Gpc^{-3}}$.
Such a possibility will be unambiguously tested in the era of gravitational
wave astronomy.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5516v2
Highly beamed, short-duration electromagnetic bursts could be produced by
superconducting cosmic string (SCS) loops oscillating in cosmic magnetic
fields. We demonstrated that the basic characteristics of SCS bursts such as
the electromagnetic frequency and the energy release could be consistently
exhibited in the recently discovered fast radio bursts (FRBs). Moreover, it is
first showed that the redshift distribution of the FRBs can also be well
accounted for by the SCS burst model. Such agreements between the FRBs and SCS
bursts suggest that the FRBs could originate from SCS bursts and thus they
could provide an effective probe to study SCSs. The obtained values of model
parameters indicate that the loops generating the FRBs have a small length
scale and they are mostly formed in the radiation-dominated cosmological epoch.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3520v3
Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) are expected to be associated with the
afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while a short-lived,
supermassive neutron star (NS) forms during the GRBs. I investigate the
possible contributions to the dispersion measure (DM) of the FRBs from the GRB
ejecta and the wind blown from the precollapsing NS. On the one hand, sometimes
an internal X-ray plateau afterglow could be produced by the NS wind, which
indicates that a great number of electron-positron pairs are carried by the
wind. If the pair-generation radius satisfies a somewhat rigorous condition,
the relativistic and dense wind would contribute a high DM to the associated
FRB, which can be comparable to and even exceed the DM contributed by the
intergalactic medium. On the other hand, if the wind only carries a
Goldreich-Julian particle flux, its DM contribution would become negligible;
meanwhile, the internal plateau afterglow would not appear. Alternatively, the
FRB should be associated with a GRB afterglow produced by the GRB external
shock, i.e., an energy-injection-caused shallow-decay afterglow or a normal
single-power-law afterglow if the impulsive energy release of the GRB is high
enough. In the latter case, the DM contributed by the high-mass GRB ejecta
could be substantially important, in particular, for an environment of
main-sequence stellar wind. In summary, a careful assessment on the various DM
contributors could be required for the cosmological application of the expected
FRB-GRB association. The future DM measurements of GRB-associated FRBs could
provide a constraint on the physics of NS winds.

Millisecond duration bright radio pulses at 1.4-GHz with high dispersion
measures (DM) were reported by Lorimer et al., Keane et al., and Thornton et
al. Their all-sky rate is $\approx 10^4$/day above $\sim$1 Jy. Related events
are "Perytons" -- similar pulsed, dispersed sources, but most certainly local.
Suggested models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can originate in the Earth's
atmosphere, in stellar coronae, in other galaxies, and even at cosmological
distances. Using physically motivated assumptions combined with observed
properties, we explore these models. In our analysis, we focus on the Lorimer
event: a 30 Jy, 5-ms duration burst with DM$=$ 375 cm$^{-3}$ pc, exhibiting a
steep frequency-dependent pulse width (the {\it Sparker}). To be complete, we
drop the assumption that high DMs are produced by plasma propagation and assume
that the source produces pulses with frequency-dependent arrival time ("chirped
signals"). Within this framework we explore a scenario in which Perytons, the
{\it Sparker}, and the FRBs are all atmospheric phenomenon occurring at
different heights. This model is {\it ad hoc} in that we cannot explain why
Perytons at higher altitudes show greater DMs or exhibit narrower pulses.
Nonetheless, we argue the {\it Sparker} may be a Peryton. We end with two
remarks. First, the detection of a single FRB by an interferometer with a
kilometer (or longer) baseline will prove that FRBs are of extra-terrestrial
origin. Second, we urge astronomers to pursue observations and understanding of
Perytons since they form (at least) a formidable foreground for the FRBs.

Batch codes are a family of codes that represent a distributed storage system
(DSS) of $n$ nodes so that any batch of $t$ data symbols can be retrieved by
reading at most one symbol from each node. Fractional repetition codes are a
family of codes for DSS that enable efficient uncoded repairs of failed nodes.
In this work these two families of codes are combined to obtain fractional
repetition batch (FRB) codes which provide both uncoded repairs and parallel
reads of subsets of stored symbols. In addition, new batch codes which can
tolerate node failures are considered. This new family of batch codes is called
erasure combinatorial batch codes (ECBCs). Some properties of FRB codes and
ECBCs and examples of their constructions based on transversal designs and
affine planes are presented.

We discuss how we can detect and identify counterparts of fast radio bursts
(FRBs) in future optical follow up observations of FRBs if real-time alert of
FRBs becomes available. We consider kilonovae as candidates of FRB optical
counterparts, as expected in the case that FRBs originate from mergers of
double neutron star binaries. Although theoretical predictions on luminosities
of kilonovae are still highly uncertain, recent models suggest that kilonovae
can be detected at redshifts up to z $\sim$ 0.3 within the range of the
uncertainties. We expect $\sim$ 1--5 unrelated supernovae (SNe) down to a
similar variability magnitude in 5 days interval within the typical error
radius of a FRB. We show that, however, a kilonova can be distinguished from
these SNe by its rapid decay and/or color evolution, making it possible to
verify the existence of a kilonova associated with a FRB. We also discuss the
case that SNe Ia are FRB optical counterparts, as it might be if FRBs originate
from double white dwarf binaries. Verification of this scenario is also
possible, since the chance probability of finding a SNe Ia having consistent
explosion time with that of a FRB within the FRB error region is small
(typically $\lesssim$ 0.01).

The physical nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is not identified. Detecting
electromagnetic counterparts in other wavelengths is essential to measure their
distances and to settle down their physical nature. Assuming that at least some
of them are of a cosmological origin, we calculate their afterglow lightcurves
in multi-wavelengths (X-rays, optical and radio) by assuming a range of their
total kinetic energies and redshifts. We focus on forward shock emission, but
also consider the possibility that some of them might have bright reverse shock
emission. In general, the FRB afterglows are too faint to be detected by
current detectors. Only if an FRB has a very low radiative efficiency in radio
(hence, a very large kinetic energy), and when it is close enough, can its
afterglow be detected in the optical and radio bands. We discuss observational
strategies to detect these faint afterglows using future telescopes such as
LSST and EVLA.

It is pointed out that the positional distribution of Fast Radio Bursts
(FRBs) shows proximity and clustering around the ecliptic. Their dispersion
measure (DM) has a weak (80 percent significance level) correlation with the
magnitude of the ecliptic latitude. The so called Perytons, however, show no
significant proximity to any one of the three astronomical planes, viz
celestial, ecliptic or galactic, although they are closer to the galactic
plane.

We report the detection of a dispersed Fast Radio Burst (FRB) in archival
intermediate-latitude Parkes Radio Telescope data. The burst appears to be of
the same physical origin as the four purported extragalactic FRBs reported by
Thornton et al. (2013). This burst's arrival time precedes the Thornton et
al.~bursts by ten years. We consider that this survey, and many other archival
low-latitude (|gb|<30deg) pulsar surveys, have been searched for FRBs but
produced fewer detections than the comparatively brief Thornton et al.~search.
Such a rate dependence on Galactic position could provide critical supporting
evidence for an extragalactic origin for FRBs. To test this, we form an
analytic expression to account for Galactic position and survey setup in FRB
rate predictions. Employing a sky temperature, scattering, and dispersion model
of the Milky Way, we compute the expected number of FRBs if they are
isotropically distributed on the sky w.r.t. Galactic position (i.e. local), and
if they are of extragalactic origin. We demonstrate that the relative detection
rates reject a local origin with a confidence of 99.96% (~3.6 sigma). The
extragalactic predictions provide a better agreement, however are still strong
discrepancies with the low-latitude detection rate at a confidence of 99.69%
(~2.9 sigma). However, for the extragalactic population, the differences in
predicted vs.~detected population may be accounted for by a number of factors,
which we discuss.

We discuss the recently reported discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the
framework of the neutron star-neutron star (NS+NS) or neutron star-black hole
(NS+BH) binary merger model. We concentrate on what we consider to be an issue
of greatest importance: what is the NS merger rate given that the FRB rate
(1/1000 yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy) is inconsistent with gamma-ray burst rate as
discussed by Thornton and should be significantly higher. We show that there is
no discrepancy between NS merger rate and observed FRB rates in the framework
of the Scenario Machine population synthesis - for a kick velocity of 100-150
km s$^{-1}$ an average NS merger rate is 1/500-1/2000 yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy up
to z = 0.5-1. Based on the Scenario Machine NS merger rate estimates, we
discuss the lack of positive detections on the ground-based interferometers,
considering the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.

We describe an ongoing search for pulsars and dispersed pulses of radio
emission, such as those from rotating radio transients (RRATs) and fast radio
bursts (FRBs), at 350 MHz using the Green Bank Telescope. With the Green Bank
Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument, we record 100 MHz of bandwidth divided
into 4,096 channels every 81.92 $\mu s$. This survey will cover the entire sky
visible to the Green Bank Telescope ($\delta > -40^\circ$, or 82% of the sky)
and outside of the Galactic Plane will be sensitive enough to detect slow
pulsars and low dispersion measure ($<$30 $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$) millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) with a 0.08 duty cycle down to 1.1 mJy. For pulsars with a
spectral index of $-$1.6, we will be 2.5 times more sensitive than previous and
ongoing surveys over much of our survey region. Here we describe the survey,
the data analysis pipeline, initial discovery parameters for 62 pulsars, and
timing solutions for 5 new pulsars. PSR J0214$+$5222 is an MSP in a long-period
(512 days) orbit and has an optical counterpart identified in archival data.
PSR J0636$+$5129 is an MSP in a very short-period (96 minutes) orbit with a
very low mass companion (8 $M_\mathrm{J}$). PSR J0645$+$5158 is an isolated MSP
with a timing residual RMS of 500 ns and has been added to pulsar timing array
experiments. PSR J1434$+$7257 is an isolated, intermediate-period pulsar that
has been partially recycled. PSR J1816$+$4510 is an eclipsing MSP in a
short-period orbit (8.7 hours) and may have recently completed its spin-up
phase.

The detection of six Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has recently been reported.
FRBs are short duration ($\sim$ 1 ms), highly dispersed radio pulses from
astronomical sources. The physical interpretation for the FRBs remains unclear
but is thought to involve highly compact objects at cosmological distance. It
has been suggested that a fraction of FRBs could be physically associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent radio observations of GRBs have reported the
detection of two highly dispersed short duration radio pulses using a 12 m
radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. Motivated by this result, we have performed a
systematic and sensitive search for FRBs associated with GRBs. We have observed
five GRBs at 2.3 GHz using a 26 m radio telescope located at the Mount Pleasant
Radio Observatory, Hobart. The radio telescope was automated to rapidly respond
to Gamma-ray Coordination Network notifications from the Swift satellite and
slew to the GRB position within $\sim$ 140 s. The data were searched for pulses
up to 5000 pc $\rm cm^{-3}$ in dispersion measure and pulse widths ranging from
640 $\rm \mu$s to 25.60 ms. We did not detect any events $\rm \geq 6 \sigma$.
An in-depth statistical analysis of our data shows that events detected above
$\rm 5 \sigma$ are consistent with thermal noise fluctuations only. A joint
analysis of our data with previous experiments shows that previously claimed
detections of FRBs from GRBs are unlikely to be astrophysical. Our results are
in line with the lack of consistency noted between the recently presented FRB
event rates and GRB event rates.

The fast (ms) radio bursts reported by Thornton, {\it et al.} have extremely
high brightness temperatures if at the inferred cosmological distances. This
implies coherent emission by "bunches" of charges. We model the emission region
as a screen of dipole radiators resonant at the frequency of observation and
calculate the necessary charge bunching. From this we infer the minimum
electron energy required to overcome electrostatic repulsion. The FRB, like the
giant pulses of the Crab pulsar, display banded spectra that may be harmonics
of plasma frequency emission by plasma turbulence. If FRB are the counterparts
of comparatively frequent Galactic events, these may be detected by radio
telescopes in their far sidelobes or by small arrays of dipoles.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5945v1
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are an emerging class of bright, highly dispersed
radio pulses. Recent work by Thornton et al. (2013) has revealed a population
of FRBs in the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at high Galactic
latitudes. A variety of progenitors have been proposed including cataclysmic
events at cosmological distances, Galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radio
frequency interference. Here we report on a search for FRBs at intermediate
Galactic latitudes ($-15^{\circ}$ $< b <$ 15$^{\circ}$) in data taken as part
of the HTRU survey. No FRBs were discovered in this region. Several effects
such as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature and scintillation decrease the
sensitivity by more than 3$\sigma$ in $\sim$20\% of survey pointings. Including
all of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that FRBs are uniformly
distributed on the sky with 99\% confidence. This low probability implies that
additional factors -- not accounted for by standard Galactic models -- must be
included to ease the discrepancy between the detection rates at high and low
Galactic latitudes. A revised rate estimate or another strong and heretofore
unknown selection effect in Galactic latitude would provide closer agreement
between the surveys' detection rates. The dearth of detections at low Galactic
latitude disfavors a Galactic origin for these bursts.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2927v2
We discuss the possibility of using fast radio bursts (FRBs), if
cosmological, as a viable cosmic probe. We find out that the contribution of
the host galaxies to the detected dispersion measures can be inapparent for the
FRBs not from galaxy centers or star forming regions. The inhomogeneity of the
intergalactic medium (IGM), however, causes significant deviation of the
dispersion measure from that predicted in the simplified homogeneous IGM model
for individual event. Fortunately, with sufficient FRBs along different
sightlines but within a very narrow redshift interval (e.g., $\Delta z \sim
0.05$ or $\Delta z \sim 0.05(1+z)$), the mean from averaging observed
dispersion measures does not suffer such a problem and hence may be used as a
cosmic probe. We show that in the optimistic case (e.g., tens FRBs in each
$\Delta z$ have been measured; the most distant FRBs were at redshift $\geq 3$;
the host galaxies and the FRB sources contribute little to the detected
dispersion measures) and with all the uncertainties (i.e. the inhomogeneity of
the IGM, the contribution and uncertainty of host galaxies as well as the
evolution and error of $f_{\rm IGM}$) considered, FRBs could help constrain the
equation of state of dark energy.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7873v2
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are new transient radio sources discovered recently.
Because of the angular resolution restriction in radio surveys, no optical
counter part has been identified yet so it is hard to determine the progenitor
of FRBs. In this paper we propose to use radio lensing survey to constrain FRB
progenitors. We show that, different types of progenitors lead to different
probabilities for a FRB to be gravitationally lensed by dark matter halos in
foreground galaxies, since different type progenitors result in different
redshift distributions of FRBs. For example, the redshift distribution of FRBs
arising from double stars shifts toward lower redshift than of the FRBs arising
from single stars, because double stars and single stars have different
evolution timescales. With detailed calculations, we predict that the FRB
sample size for producing one lensing event varies significantly for different
FRB progenitor models. We argue that this fact can be used to distinguish
different FRB models and also discuss the practical possibility of using
lensing observation in radio surveys to constrain FRB progenitors.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2498v2
Recently, both theoretical arguments and observational evidence suggested
that a small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) could be associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). If such FRB/GRB association systems are commonly
detected in the future, the combination of dispersion measure (DM) derived from
FRBs and redshifts derived from GRBs makes these systems a plausible tool to
conduct cosmography. We quantify uncertainties in deriving the
redshift-dependent DM_{IGM} as a function of z, and test how well dark energy
models can be constrained with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that with
potentially several 10s of FRB/GRB systems detected in a decade or so, one may
reach reasonable constraints on wCDM models. When combined with SN Ia data,
unprecedented constraints on dark energy equation of state may be achieved,
thanks to the prospects of detecting FRB/GRB systems at relatively high
redshifts. The ratio between the mean value < DM_{IGM} (z)> and luminosity
distance (D_{L} (z)) is insensitive to dark energy models. This gives the
prospects of applying SN Ia data to calibrate < DM_{IGM} (z)> using a
relatively small sample of FRB/GRB systems, allowing a reliable constraint on
the baryon inhomogeneity distribution as a function of redshift. The
methodology developed in this paper can also be applied, if the FRB redshifts
can be measured by other means. Some caveats of putting this method into
practice are also discussed.

Recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,
millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (DMs). These
bursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalactic
sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for
probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source
classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been
detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some
concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB
121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes.
FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-GHz Pulsar
ALFA survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pc
cm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellar
scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees
precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite
its low Galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times the
maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting an
extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;
we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA
receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are
all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6327v2
Recent observations of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) suggest that binary
neutron star (NS) mergers can create highly magnetised, millisecond NSs. Sharp
cut-offs in X-ray afterglow plateaus of some SGRBs hint at the gravitational
collapse of these remnant NSs to black holes. The collapse of such
`supramassive' NSs also describes the blitzar model, a leading candidate for
the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The observation of an FRB
associated with an SGRB would provide compelling evidence for the blitzar model
and the binary NS merger scenario of SGRBs, and lead to interesting constraints
on the NS equation of state. We predict the collapse times of supramassive NSs
created in binary NS mergers, finding that such stars collapse $\sim10\,{\rm
s}$ -- $4.4\times10^{4}\,{\rm s}$ (95% confidence) after the merger. This
directly impacts observations targeting NS remnants of binary NS mergers,
providing the optimal window for high time resolution radio and X-ray follow-up
of SGRBs and gravitational wave bursts.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1795v3
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are isolated, $\ms$ radio pulses with dispersion
measure (DM) of order $10^3\DMunit$. Galactic candidates for the DM of high
latitude bursts detected at $\GHz$ frequencies are easily dismissed. DM from
bursts emitted in stellar coronas are limited by free-free absorption and those
from HII regions are bounded by the nondetection of associated free-free
emission at radio wavelengths. Thus, if astronomical, FRBs are probably
extra-galactic. FRB 110220 has a scattering tail of $\sim 5.6\pm 0.1 \ms$. If
the electron density fluctuations arise from a turbulent cascade, the
scattering is unlikely to be due to propagation through the diffuse
intergalactic plasma. A more plausible explanation is that this burst sits in
the central region of its host galaxy. Pulse durations of order $\ms$ constrain
the sizes of FRB sources implying high brightness temperatures that indicates
coherent emission. Electric fields near FRBs at cosmological distances would be
so strong that they could accelerate free electrons from rest to relativistic
energies in a single wave period.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0268v1
The recent detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has generated strong
interest in identifying the origin of these bright, non-repeating, highly
dispersed pulses. The principal limitation in understanding the origin of these
bursts is the lack of reliable distance estimates; their high dispersion
measures imply that they may be at cosmological distances ($0.1 < z < 1.0$).
Here we discuss new distance constraints to the FRB010621 (a.k.a J1852$-$08)
first reported by Keane. We use velocity resolved $H\alpha$ and $H\beta$
observations of diffuse ionised gas toward the burst to calculate an
extinction-corrected emission measure along the line of sight. We combine this
emission measure with models of Galactic rotation and of electron distribution
to derive a 90% probability of the pulse residing in the Galaxy. However, we
cannot differentiate between the two Galactic interpretations of Keane: a
neutron star with unusual pulse amplitude distribution or Galactic black hole
annihilation.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0059v2
If a small fraction of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are associated with Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs), as recently suggested by Zhang, the combination of redshift
measurements of GRBs and dispersion measure (DM) measurements of FRBs opens a
new window to study cosmology. At $z<2$ where the universe is essentially fully
ionized, detections of FRB/GRB pairs can give an independent measurement of the
intergalactic medium portion of the baryon mass fraction, $\Omega_b f_{\rm
IGM}$, of the universe. If a good sample of FRB/GRB associations are discovered
at higher redshifts, the free electron column density history can be mapped,
which can be used to probe the reionization history of both hydrogen and helium
in the universe. We apply our formulation to GRBs 101011A and 100704A that each
might have an associated FRB, and constrained $\Omega_b f_{\rm IGM}$ to be
consistent with the value derived from other methods. The methodology developed
here is also applicable, if the redshifts of FRBs not associated with GRBs can
be measured by other means.

Let $\frb$ be a fixed Borel subalgebra of a finite-dimensional complex simple
Lie algebra $\frg$. The Shi bijection associates to every ad-nilpotent ideal
$\fri$ of $\frb$ a region $V_{\fri}$. In this paper, we show that $\fri$ is
abelian if and only if $V_{\fri}\cap 2A$ is empty, if and only if the volume of
$V_{\fri}\cap 2A$ equals to that of $A$, where $A$ is the fundamental alcove of
the affine Weyl group. For certain flag of abelian ideals, we record an
ascending property of their associated regions. We also determine the maximal
eigenvalue $m_{r-1}$ of the Casimir operator on $\wedge^{r-1} \frg$ and the
corresponding eigenspace $M_{r-1}$, where $r$ is the number of positive roots.

Six cases of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have recently been discovered. The FRBs
are bright (~0.1 - 1 Jy) and brief (~ 1 ms) pulses of radio emission with
dispersion measures (DMs) that exceed Galactic values, and hence FRBs have been
interpreted to be at cosmological distances. We propose, instead, that FRBs are
rare eruptions of flaring main-sequence stars within ~1 kpc. Rather than
associating their excess DM with the intergalactic medium, we relate it to a
blanket of coronal plasma around their host stars. We have monitored at optical
bands the stars within the radio beams of three of the known FRBs. In one
field, we find a bright (V=13.6 mag) variable star (0.2 mag peak-to-trough)
with a main-sequence G-type spectrum and a period P = 7.8 hr, likely a
W-UMa-type contact binary. Analysis of our data outside of the FRB beams
indicates a 5% chance probability of finding a variable star of this brightness
and amplitude within the FRB beams. We find no unusual variable stars in the
other two FRB fields. Further observations are needed to investigate if similar
nearby (<~ 800 pc) stars are the sources of FRBs.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4893v2
The physical nature of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), a new type of cosmological
transients discovered recently, is not known. It has been suggested that FRBs
can be produced when a spinning supra-massive neutron star loses centrifugal
support and collapses to a black hole. Here we suggest that such implosions can
happen in supra-massive neutron stars shortly (hundreds to thousands of
seconds) after their births, and an observational signature of such implosions
may have been observed in the X-ray afterglows of some long and short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). Within this picture, a small fraction of FRBs would be
physically connected to GRBs. We discuss possible multi-wavelength
electromagnetic signals and gravitational wave signals that might be associated
with FRBs, and propose an observational campaign to unveil the physical nature
of FRBs. In particular, we strongly encourage a rapid radio follow-up
observation of GRBs starting from 100 s after GRB triggers.
 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4985v3
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances have recently been
discovered, whose duration is about milliseconds. We argue that the observed
short duration is difficult to explain by giant flares of soft gamma-ray
repeaters, though their event rate and energetics are consistent with FRBs.
Here we discuss binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers as a possible origin of
FRBs. The FRB rate is within the plausible range of NS-NS merger rate and its
cosmological evolution, while a large fraction of NS-NS mergers must produce
observable FRBs. A likely radiation mechanism is coherent radio emission like
radio pulsars, by magnetic braking when magnetic fields of neutron stars are
synchronized to binary rotation at the time of coalescence. Magnetic fields of
the standard strength (~ 10^{12-13} G) can explain the observed FRB fluxes, if
the conversion efficiency from magnetic braking energy loss to radio emission
is similar to that of isolated radio pulsars. Corresponding gamma-ray emission
is difficult to detect by current or past gamma-ray burst satellites. Since
FRBs tell us the exact time of mergers, a correlated search would significantly
improve the effective sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.

We consider non-autonomous wave equations \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} \&\ddot
u(t) + \B(t)\dot u(t) + \A(t)u(t) = f(t) \quad t\text{-a.e.}\\ \&u(0)=u_0,\,

$\B(t)$ are associated with time-dependent sesquilinear forms $\fra(t,.,.)$ and
$\frb$ defined on a Hilbert space $H$ with the same domain $V$. The initial
values satisfy $ u_0 \in V$ and $u_1 \in H$. We prove well-posedness and
maximal regularity for the solution both in the spaces $V'$ and $H$. We apply
the results to non-autonomous Robin-boundary conditions and also use maximal
regularity to solve a quasilinear problem.

Recently, Thornton et al. reported the detection of four fast radio bursts
(FRBs). The dispersion measures indicate that the sources of these FRBs are at
cosmological distance. Given the large full sky event rate ~ 10^4 sky^-1
day^-1, the FRBs are a promising target for multi-messenger astronomy. Here we
propose double degenerate, binary white-dwarf (WD) mergers as the source of
FRBs, which are produced by coherent emission from the polar region of a
rapidly rotating, magnetized massive WD formed after the merger. The basic
characteristics of the FRBs, such as the energetics, emission duration and
event rate, can be consistently explained in this scenario. As a result, we
predict that some FRBs can accompany type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) or X-ray
debris disks. Simultaneous detection could test our scenario and probe the
progenitors of SNe Ia, and moreover would provide a novel constraint on the
cosmological parameters. We strongly encourage future SN and X-ray surveys that
follow up FRBs.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short timescale (<<1 s) astrophysical radio
signals, presumed to be a signature of cataclysmic events of extragalactic
origin. The discovery of six high-redshift events at ~1400 MHz from the Parkes
radio telescope suggests that FRBs may occur at a high rate across the sky. The
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) operates at low radio frequencies (80-300 MHz)
and is expected to detect FRBs due to its large collecting area (~2500 m^2) and
wide field-of-view (FOV, ~1000 square degrees at nu=200 MHz). We compute the
expected number of FRB detections for the MWA assuming a source population
consistent with the reported detections. Our formalism properly accounts for
the frequency-dependence of the antenna primary beam, the MWA system
temperature, and unknown spectral index of the source population, for three
modes of FRB detection: coherent; incoherent; and fast imaging. We find that
the MWA's sensitivity and large FOV combine to provide the expectation of
multiple detectable events per week in all modes, potentially making it an
excellent high time resolution science instrument. Deviations of the expected
number of detections from actual results will provide a strong constraint on
the assumptions made for the underlying source population and intervening
plasma distribution.

Fuzzy systems concern fundamental methodology to represent and process
uncertainty and imprecision in the linguistic information. The fuzzy systems
that use fuzzy rules to represent the domain knowledge of the problem are known
as Fuzzy Rule Base Systems (FRBS). On the other hand image segmentation and
subsequent extraction from a noise-affected background, with the help of
various soft computing methods, are relatively new and quite popular due to
various reasons. These methods include various Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
models (primarily supervised in nature), Genetic Algorithm (GA) based
techniques, intensity histogram based methods etc. providing an extraction
solution working in unsupervised mode happens to be even more interesting
problem. Literature suggests that effort in this respect appears to be quite
rudimentary. In the present article, we propose a fuzzy rule guided novel
technique that is functional devoid of any external intervention during
execution. Experimental results suggest that this approach is an efficient one
in comparison to different other techniques extensively addressed in
literature. In order to justify the supremacy of performance of our proposed
technique in respect of its competitors, we take recourse to effective metrics
like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio (PSNR).

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $B$ be the Borel subgroup of
$\mGL_n(k)$ consisting of nonsingular upper triangular matrices. Let $\frb =
\mLie B$ be the Lie algebra of upper triangular $n \times n$ matrices and
$\fru$ the Lie subalgebra of $\frb$ consisting of strictly upper triangular
matrices. We classify all Lie ideals $\frn$ of $\frb$, satisfying $\fru'
\subseteq \frn \subseteq \fru$, such that $B$ acts (by conjugation) on $\frn$
with a dense orbit. Further, in case $B$ does not act with a dense orbit, we
give the minimal codimension of a $B$--orbit in $\frn$. This can be viewed as a
first step towards the difficult open problem of classifying of all ideals
$\frn \subseteq \fru$ such that $B$ acts on $\frn$ with a dense orbit.
  The proofs of our main results require a translation into the representation
theory of a certain quasi-hereditary algebra $\cA_{t,1}$. In this setting we
find the minimal dimension of $\mExt^1_{\cA_{t,1}}(M,M)$ for a $\Delta$-good
$\cA_{t,1}$--module of certain fixed $\Delta$-dimension vectors.

Using the descriptive method of log-periodic power laws (LPPL) based on a
theory of behavioral herding, we use a battery of parametric and non-parametric
tests to demonstrate the existence of an antibubble in the yields with
maturities larger than 1 year since October 2000. The concept of ``antibubble''
describes the existence of a specific LPPL pattern that is thought to reflect
collective herding effects. From the dependence of the parameters of the LPPL
formula as a function of yield maturities and using lagged cross-correlation
calculations between the S&P 500 and bond yields, we find strong evidence for
the following causality: Stock Market $\to$ Fed Reserve (Federal funds rate)
$\to$ short-term yields $\to$ long-term yields (as well as a direct and
instantaneous influence of the stock market on the long-term yields). Our
interpretation is that the FRB is ``causally slaved'' to the stock market (at
least for the studied period), because the later is (taken as) a proxy for the
present and future health of the economy.

I derive the mass-temperature relation and its time evolution for clusters of
galaxies in different cosmologies by means of two different models. The first
one is a modification and improvement of a model by Del Popolo & Gambera(1999),
namely based upon a modification of the top-hat model in order to take account
of angular momentum acquisition by protostructures and of an external pressure
term in the virial theorem. The second one is based on the merging-halo
formalism of Lacey & Cole (1993), accounting for the fact that massive clusters
accrete matter quasi-continuously, and is an improvement of a model proposed by
Voit (2000). The final result is that, in both models, the M-T relation shows a
break at T \sim 3-4 keV. The behavior of the M-T relation is as usual, M
\propto T^{3/2}, at the high mass end, and M \propto T^{\gamma}, with a value
of \gamma>3/2 depending on the chosen cosmology. The evolution of the M-T
relation, for a given M_{\rm vir}, is more modest both in flat and open
universes in comparison to previous estimate found in literature, even more
modest than what found by V2000. Moreover the time evolution is more rapid in
models with L=0 than in models in which the angular momentum acquisition by
protostructures is taken into account (L \neq 0). The effect of a non-zero
cosmological constant is that of slightly increasing the evolution of the M-T
relation with respect to open models with L \neq 0. The evolution is more rapid
for larger values (in absolute value) of the spectral index, n. The comparison
of the mass-temperature relation with the data by Finoguenov, Reiprich &
Bohringer (2001), shows that the FRB data is able to rule out very low Omega_0
models (<0.3), particularly in the open case, and that better fit are obtained
by LambdaCDM models and by CDM models with Omega_0>0.3.

The binding energy of A3C60, a conductor, is described well by an ionic solid
type calculation. This succeeds because there is little overlap between
molecular wave functions on neighbouring sites, so that electrons are
practically localized on-shell. This leads one to believe that even in A4C60
and A6C60 systems such calculation may suffice. However, for large charge on
the anion, there is a possibility for some electrons to delocalize and go into
the s-band. We calculate binding energy, keeping these delocalised electrons x,
as a parameter and minimize the energy w.r.t. it. We take the intermolecular
interaction to be arising out of a C-C potential of 6-exp form and a screened
Coulomb interaction between the anions and cations and among themselves. Model
calculations are presented for K1C60, K3C60, K4C60 and K6C60 for which the
minimum energy state shows no delocalisation. Cohesive Energy dependence on
Lattice constant is used to calculate Bulk Modulus for all systems. We have got
a reasonably good resemblance with experimental values. Further, we observe
that the cohesive energy shows poor resemblance with experimental values.
Further, delocalisation of a fraction of electron at the centre of double bond
show considerable increase in cohesive energy.

The process of photon splitting $\gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ in a strong
magnetic field is investigated both below and above the pair creation
threshold. Contrary to the statement by Baier et al., the ``allowed'' channel
$\alw$ is shown not to be a comprehensive description of splitting in the
strong field because the ``forbidden'' channel $\frb$ is also essential. The
partial amplitudes and the splitting probabilities are calculated taking
account of the photon dispersion and large radiative corrections near the
resonance.
