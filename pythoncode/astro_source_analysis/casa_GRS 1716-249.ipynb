With the tightest arrangement of the antennae and the shortest wavelength, the VLA has a FOV of 1.3 arcseconds. In the loosest arrangement and at the longest wavelength, the FOV increases to 5.6 degrees. Similarly, in the tightest arrangement and at the shortest wavelength, the array has an angular resolution of 0.05 arcseconds whereas in the loosest arrangement and at the longest wavelength, the resolution is 14.2 arcminutes.

    "The meaning of these columns is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANT MOVED\n",
    "the date on which the antenna was moved to the indicated pad. A blank in this field does NOT mean \"ditto\" -- it means \"not moved\". Corrections in these entries have been re-determined relative to the previous entry for that antenna, i.e. these are corrections to the previous position.\n",
    "OBSDATE\n",
    "the date on which the observations used to determine these corrections were taken.\n",
    "Put_In_\n",
    "the date on which these corrections were added to the positions in the ModComps (the computers which run the VLA).\n",
    "MC(IAT)\n",
    "the IAT at which these corrections were entered into the ModComps.\n",
    "ANT\n",
    "the antenna number, as given e.g. in the AN table in AIPS.\n",
    "PAD\n",
    "the pad on which that antenna was sitting when the observations were made (as listed e.g. by the AIPS task PRTAN).\n",
    "Bx, By, Bz\n",
    "XYZ are in a right-handed Cartesian system. X and Y lie in a plane parallel to the equator. X points toward the intersection of the local meridian and the celestial equator, Y points East, Z points to the North pole. (reference: Thomson, Moran & Swenson, 2nd edition 2001, p86, chap. 4.1)\n",
    "These corrections are ADDITIVE. To determine the appropriate correction for your observations, you should add up all corrections measured between the MOVE date and the next move after your observing run, excluding any corrections entered into the ModComps before your observing began.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE: Based on the above listing, antenna 7 was moved to pad W16 on 28 May 1997. The 10 June 1997 baseline run gave a -0.0144m correction to its z-coordinate, which was entered into the on-line system on 12 June 1998 at 19:50 IAT. Further corrections were determined on the 24th and the 27th. Let's assume this is the whole story, i.e. no further measurements were made before the telescope was moved to a new pad. If you observed between 28 May and 12 June, you would have to enter the sum of all three corrections; between 12 and 25 June, the sum of the 24 and 27 June corrections; beteen 25 and 28 June, only the 27 June correction; thereafter, no correction is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, one should use the sum of all available corrections. However, antennas may indeed shift slightly over time, even when staying on the same pad. The test for an individual data set is either to solve for the antenna positions yourself, using those data; or to see what happens to your phases before and after these corrections, and judge for yourself whether the corrections have improved matters."
