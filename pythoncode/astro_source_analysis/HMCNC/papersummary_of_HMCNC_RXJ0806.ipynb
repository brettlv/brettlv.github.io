    "in each system, X-ray flux peaks ~0.2 cycles after optical flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "In majority of models, X-rays coms from a spot on the primary star which moves in and out of view as it rotates.  \n",
    "In IP model, modulation results from accretion stream flipping from one pole to the other although it seems unlikely X-ray can be completely switched off.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within double degenerate models, these seems likely to originate from the heated face of secondary star. Such heating may be result of X-ray emission from primary star or primary star could be hot for compressional heating.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the 0.2 cycles delay of the X-ray peak relative to the optical peak implies X-ray emission spot is rotated ~0.3 cycles from directly facing secondary star, in the direction of orbit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The X-ray/optical phase shifts in V407 Vul and HM Cnc are very naturally explained by both the direct impact and double-degenerate polar models\n",
    "\n",
    "there is no natural explanation for the phase shift in the unipolar inductor model for which one would expect antiphasing, unless there is some as yet undiscovered mechanism for displacing the magnetic footprint of the secondary star in advance of its orbit\n",
    "\n",
    "The X-ray/optical phase shift is also a difficulty\n",
    "for the IP model of Norton et al. (2004) for which they also predict\n",
    "antiphasing with the optical pulses appearing as the accretion stream\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color=red>impact angle:</font>as the angle between X-ray emission site and the secondary star. \n",

    "The offsets are naturally\n",

    "both polar and direct impact, but seem hard to reconcile with\n",
    "the unipolar inductor and IP models. The optical light curves of\n",

    "that there is likely a contribution to the optical light from the same\n",
