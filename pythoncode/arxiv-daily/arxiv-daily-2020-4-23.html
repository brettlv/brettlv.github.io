<p>We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of SN2020bvc (=ASASSN20bs;
ZTF20aalxlis), a nearby ($z=0.0252$; $d$=114 Mpc) broad-lined (BL) Type Ic
supernova (SN). Our observations show that SN2020bvc shares several properties
in common with the Ic-BL SN2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity
gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio light curve is on the
faint end of LLGRB-SNe ($L_\mathrm{radio} \approx 10^{37}$erg/s): we model our
VLA observations (spanning 13-43 d) as synchrotron emission from a mildly
relativistic ($v \gtrsim 0.3c$) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra
we detect X-ray emission ($L_X \approx 10^{41}$erg/s) that is not naturally
explained as inverse Compton emission or as part of the same synchrotron
spectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence ($6\times$/night) data from
the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) shows a double-peaked optical light curve,
the first peak from shock-cooling emission from extended low-mass material
(mass $M<10^{-2} M_\odot$ at radius $R>10^{12}$cm) and the second peak from the
radioactive decay of Ni-56. SN2020bvc is the first confirmed double-peaked
Ic-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, and shows X-ray and radio emission
similar to LLGRB-SNe: this is consistent with models in which the same
mechanism produces both the LLGRB and the shock-cooling emission. For four of
the five other nearby ($z\lesssim0.05$) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data,
we rule out a first peak like that seen in SN2006aj and SN2020bvc, i.e. that
lasts $\approx 1$d and reaches a peak luminosity $M \approx -18$. X-ray and
radio follow-up observations of future such events will establish whether
double-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray
and radio emission.</p>

<p>We present 3, 15, and 33 GHz imaging towards galaxy nuclei and extranuclear
star-forming regions using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array as part of the
Star Formation in Radio Survey. With $3-33$ GHz radio spectra, we measured the
spectral indices and corresponding thermal (free-free) emission fractions for a
sample of 335 discrete regions having significant detections in at least two
radio bands. After removing 14 likely background galaxies, we find that the
median thermal fraction at 33 GHz is $92 \pm 0.8\%$ with a median absolute
deviation of $11\%$, when a two-component power-law model is adopted to fit the
radio spectrum. Limiting the sample to 238 sources that are confidently
identified as star-forming regions, and not affected by potential AGN
contamination (i.e., having galactocentric radii $r_{\rm G} \geq 250$ pc),
results in a median thermal fraction of $93 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median absolute
deviation of $10\%$. We further measure the thermal fraction at 33 GHz for 163
regions identified at 7" resolution to be $94 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median
absolute deviation of $8\%$. Together, these results confirm that free-free
emission dominates the radio spectra of star-forming regions on scales up to
$\sim$500 pc in normal star-forming galaxies. We additionally find a factor of
$\sim$1.6 increase in the scatter of the measured spectral index and thermal
fraction distributions as a function of decreasing galactocentric radius. This
trend is likely reflective of the continuous star-formation activity occurring
in the galaxy centers, resulting a larger contribution of diffuse nonthermal
emission relative to star-forming regions in the disk.</p>

<p>The dusty torus plays a vital role in unifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
However, the physical structure of the torus remains largely unclear. Here we
present a systematical investigation of the torus mid-infrared (MIR)
spectroscopic feature, i.e., the 9.7 um silicate line, of $175$ AGNs selected
from the Swift/BAT Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). Our sample is constructed to
ensure that each of the $175$ AGNs has Spizter/IRS MIR, optical, and X-ray
spectroscopic coverage. Therefore, we can simultaneously measure the silicate
strength, optical emission lines, and X-ray properties (e.g., the column
density and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity). We show that, consistent with
previous works, the silicate strength is weakly correlated with the hydrogen
column density ($N_\mathrm{H}^\mathrm{X}$), albeit with large scatters. For
X-ray unobscured AGNs, the silicate-strength-derived $V$-band extinction and
the broad-H$\alpha$-inferred one are both small; however, for X-ray obscured
AGNs, the former is much larger than the latter. In addition, we find that the
optical type 1 AGNs with strong X-ray absorption on average show significant
silicate absorption, indicating that their X-ray absorption might not be caused
by dust-free gas in the broad-line region. Our results suggest that the
distribution and structure of the obscuring dusty torus are likely to be very
complex. We test our results against the smooth and clumpy torus models and
find evidence in favor of the clumpy torus model.</p>

<p>A key characteristic of many active galactic nuclei (AGN) is their
variability, but its origin is poorly understood, especially in the radio
domain. Williams et al. (2017) reported a ~50 per cent increase in peak flux
density of the AGN in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 at 1.5 GHz with the e-MERLIN
array. We present new high resolution e-MERLIN observations at 5 GHz and
compare these to archival MERLIN observations to investigate the reported
variability. Our new observations allow us to probe the nuclear region at a
factor three times higher-resolution than the previous e-MERLIN study. We
separate the core component, C4, into three separate components: C4W, C4E and
X. The AGN is thought to reside in component C4W, but this component has
remained constant between epochs within uncertainties. However, we find that
the Eastern-most component, C4E, has increased in peak flux density from
19.35$\pm$1.10 to 37.09$\pm$1.86 mJy/beam, representing a 8.2 sigma increase on
the MERLIN observations. We attribute this peak flux density increase to
continued interaction between the jet and the emission line region (ELR),
observed for the first time in a low-luminosity AGN such as NGC 4151. We
identify discrete resolved components at 5 GHz along the jet axis, which we
interpret as areas of jet-ELR interaction.</p>

<p>During a search for X-ray transients in the XMM-Newton archive within the
EXTraS project, we discovered a new X-ray source that is detected only during a
~5 min interval of a ~21 h-long observation performed on 2011 June 21 (EXMM
023135.0-603743, probability of a random Poissonian fluctuation:
~$1.4\times10^{-27}$). With dedicated follow-up observations, we found that its
position is consistent with a star-forming galaxy (SFR = 1-2 $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$) at redshift $z=0.092\pm0.003$ ($d=435\pm15$ Mpc). At this redshift,
the energy released during the transient event was $2.8\times10^{46}$ erg in
the 0.3-10 keV energy band (in the source rest frame). The luminosity of the
transient, together with its spectral and timing properties, make EXMM
023135.0-603743 a gripping analog to the X-ray transient associated to SN
2008D, which was discovered during a Swift/XRT observation of the nearby
($d=27$ Mpc) supernova-rich galaxy NGC 2770. We interpret the XMM-Newton event
as a supernova shock break-out and prove that our serendipitous discovery is
compatible with the rate of core-collapse supernovae derived from optical
observations.</p>

<p>We search for signals of magnetically-induced effects in the arrival
directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger
Observatory. We apply two different methods. One is a search for sets of events
that show a correlation between their arrival direction and the inverse of
their energy, which would be expected if they come from the same point-like
source, they have the same electric charge and their deflection is relatively
small and coherent. We refer to these sets of events as "multiplets". The
second method, called "thrust", is a principal axis analysis aimed to detect
the elongated patterns in a region of interest. We study the sensitivity of
both methods using a benchmark simulation and we apply them to data in two
different searches. The first search is done assuming as source candidates a
list of nearby active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. The second is an
all-sky blind search. We report the results and we find no statistically
significant features. We discuss the compatibility of these results with the
indications on the mass composition inferred from data of the Pierre Auger
Observatory.</p>

<p>We report on the results of a NuSTAR observation of the Supergiant Fast X-ray
Transient pulsar IGRJ11215-5952 during the peak of its outburst in June 2017.
IGRJ11215-5952 is the only SFXT undergoing strictly periodic outbursts, every
165 days. NuSTAR caught several X-ray flares, spanning a dynamic range of 100,
and detected X-ray pulsations at 187.0 s, consistent with previous
measurements. The spectrum from the whole observation is well described by an
absorbed power-law (with a photon index of 1.4) modified, above 7 keV, by a
cutoff with an e-folding energy of 24 keV. A weak emission line is present at
6.4 keV, consistent with Kalpha emission from cold iron in the supergiant wind.
The time-averaged flux is 1.5E-10 erg/cm2/s (3-78 keV, corrected for the
absorption), translating into an average luminosity of about 9E35 erg/s (1-100
keV, assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). The NuSTAR observation allowed us to
perform the most sensitive search for cyclotron resonant scattering features in
the hard X-ray spectrum, resulting in no significant detection in any of the
different spectral extractions adopted (time-averaged, temporally-selected,
spin-phase-resolved and intensity-selected spectra). The pulse profile showed
an evolution with both the energy (3-12 keV energy range compared with 12-78
keV band) and the X-ray flux: a double peaked profile was evident at higher
fluxes (and in both energy bands), while a single peaked, sinusoidal profile
was present at the lowest intensity state achieved within the NuSTAR
observations (in both energy bands). The intensity-selected analysis allowed us
to observe an anti-correlation of the pulsed fraction with the X-ray
luminosity. The pulse profile evolution can be explained by X-ray photon
scattering in the accreting matter above magnetic poles of a neutron star at
the quasi-spherical settling accretion stage.</p>

<p>Investigating in the laboratory the process of matter accretion onto forming
stars through scaled experiments is important in order to better understand
star and planetary systems formation and evolution. Such experiments can indeed
complement observations by providing access to the processes with spatial and
temporal resolution. A first step has been made in [G. Revet et al., Science
Advances 3, e1700982 (2017), arXiv:1708.02528]. in allowing such
investigations. It revealed the existence of a two components stream: a hot
shell surrounding a cooler inner stream. The shell was formed by matter
laterally ejected upon impact and refocused by the local magnetic field. That
laboratory investigation was limited tonormal incidence impacts. However, in
young stellar objects, complex structure of magnetic fields causes variability
of the incidentangles of the accretion columns. This led us to undertake an
investigation, using laboratory plasmas, of the consequence of having a slanted
accretion impacting a young star. Here we use high power laser interactions and
strong magnetic field generation in the laboratory, complemented by numerical
simulations, to study the asymmetry induced upon accretion structures when
columns of matter impact the surface of young stars with an oblique angle.
Compared to the scenario where matter accretes normal to the star surface, we
observe strongly asymmetric plasma structure, strong lateral ejecta of matter,
poor confinement of the accreted material and reduced heating compared to the
normal incidence case. Thus, slanted accretion is a configuration that seems to
be capable of inducing perturbations of the chromosphere and hence possibly
influence the level of activity of the corona.</p>

<p>Kepler K2 long cadence data are used to study white light flares in a sample
of 45 L dwarfs. We identified 11 flares on 9 L dwarfs with equivalent durations
of (1.3 - 198) hr and total (UV/optical/IR) energies of $\geq$0.9 $\times$
10$^{32}$ erg. Two superflares with energies of $>$10$^{33}$ erg were detected
on an L5 dwarf: this is the coolest object so far on which flares have been
identified. The larger superflare on this L5 dwarf has an energy of 4.6$\times$
10$^{34}$ ergs and an amplitude of $>$300 times the photospheric level: so far,
this is the largest amplitude flare detected by the $Kepler/K2$ mission. The
next coolest star on which we identified a flare was an L2 dwarf: 2MASS
J08585891+1804463. Combining the energies of all the flares which we have
identified on 9 L dwarfs with the total observation time which was dedicated by
$Kepler$ to all 45 L dwarfs, we construct a composite flare frequency
distribution (FFD). The FFD slope is quite shallow (-0.51$\pm$0.17), consistent
with earlier results reported by Paudel et al. (2018) for one particular L0
dwarf, for which the FFD slope was found to be -0.34. Using the composite FFD,
we predict that, in early and mid-L dwarfs, a superflare of energy 10$^{33}$
erg occurs every 2.4 years and a superflare of energy 10$^{34}$ erg occurs
every 7.9 years. Analysis of our L dwarf flares suggests that magnetic fields
of $\geq$0.13-1.3 kG are present on the stellar surface: such fields could
suppress Type II radio bursts.</p>

<p>Deep and wide-field optical photometric observations along with
multiwavelength archival datasets have been employed to study the physical
properties of the cluster NGC 6910. The study also examines the impact of
massive stars to their environment. The age, distance and reddening of the
cluster are estimated to be $\sim$4.5 Myr, $1.72\pm0.08$ kpc, and $
E(B-V)_{min}= 0.95$ mag, respectively. The mass function slope ($\Gamma =
-0.74\pm0.15$ in the cluster region is found to be flatter than the Salpeter
value (-1.35), indicating the presence of excess number of massive stars. The
cluster also shows mass segregation towards the central region due to their
formation processes. The distribution of warm dust emission is investigated
towards the central region of the cluster, showing the signature of the impact
of massive stars within the cluster region. Radio continuum clumps powered by
massive B-type stars (age range $\sim$ 0.07-0.12 Myr) are traced, which are
located away from the center of the stellar cluster NGC 6910 (age $\sim$ 4.5
Myr). Based on the values of different pressure components exerted by massive
stars, the photoionized gas associated with the cluster is found to be the
dominant feedback mechanism in the cluster. Overall, the massive stars in the
cluster might have triggered the birth of young massive B-type stars in the
cluster. This argument is supported with evidence of the observed age gradient
between the cluster and the powering sources of the radio clumps.</p>

<p>The constrained transport (CT) method reflects the state of the art numerical
technique for preserving the divergence-free condition of magnetic field to
machine accuracy in multi-dimensional MHD simulations performed with
Godunov-type, or upwind, conservative codes. The evolution of the different
magnetic field components, located at zone interfaces using a staggered
representation, is achieved by calculating the electric field components at
cell edges, in a way that has to be consistent with the Riemann solver used for
the update of cell-centered fluid quantities at interfaces. Albeit several
approaches have been undertaken, the purpose of this work is, on the one hand,
to compare existing methods in terms of robustness and accuracy and, on the
other, to extend the upwind contrained transport (UCT) method by Londrillo &
Del Zanna (2004) and Del Zanna et al. (2007) for the systematic construction of
new averaging schemes using the information available from 1D Riemann solvers.
Our results are presented here in the context of second-order schemes for
classical MHD, but they can be easily generalized to higher than second order
schemes, either based on finite volumes or finite differences, and to other
physical systems retaining the same structure of the equations, such as that of
relativistic or general relativistic MHD.</p>

<p>Ceres is the largest body in the Main Belt, and it is characterized by a
large abundance of water ice in its interior. This feature is suggested by its
relatively low bulk density (2162 kg m$^{-3}$), while its partial
differentiation into a rocky core and icy crust is suggested by several
geological and geochemical features: minerals and salts produced by aqueous
alteration, icy patches on the surface, lobate morphology interpreted as
surface flows. In this work we explore how the composition can influence the
characteristics of thermal convection in the crust of Ceres. Our results
suggest that the onset of thermal convection is difficult and when it occurs it
is short lived and this could imply that Ceres preserved deep liquid until
present, as recent suggested by the work of Castillo-Rogez et al.. Moreover,
cryovolcanism could be driven by diapirism (chemical convection) rather than
thermal convection.</p>

<p>We monitored the z=0.158 quasar 3C273 between 2015 and 2019 in the optical
(BVrz) and near-infrared (JHK) with the aim to perform dust reverberation
mapping. Accounting for host galaxy and accretion disk contributions, we
obtained pure dust light curves in JHK. Cross correlations between the V-band
and the dust light curves yield an average rest-frame delay for the hot dust of
tau_cent ~ 410 days. This is a factor 2 shorter than expected from the the dust
ring radius R_x ~ 900 light days reported from interferometric studies. The
dust covering factor (CF) is about 8%, much smaller than predicted from the
half covering angle of 45 degree found for active galactic nuclei (AGN). We
analyse the asymmetric shape of the correlation functions and explore whether
an inclined bi-conical bowl-shaped dust torus geometry could bring these
findings (tau_cent, R_x and CF) into a consistent picture. The hot varying dust
emission originates from the edge of the bowl rim with a small covering angle
40 < theta < 45 degree, and we see only the near side of the bi-conus. Such a
dust gloriole with R_x = 900 +/- 200 ld and an inclination i = 12 degree
matches the data remarkably well. Comparing the results of 3C273 with
literature for less luminous AGN, we find a lag-luminosity relation tau propto
L^alpha with alpha between 0.33 and 0.40, flatter than the widely adopted
relation with alpha = 0.5. We address several explanations for the new lag -
luminosity relation.</p>

<p>We present spatially-resolved measurements of star formation histories
(SFHs), metallicities, and distances in three nearby elliptical galaxies and
the bulge of M31 derived using the pixel color-magnitude diagram (pCMD)
technique. We compute pCMDs from archival $\textit{HST}$ photometry of M87,
M49, NGC 3377 and M31, and fit the data using the new code $\texttt{PCMDPy}$.
We measure distances to each system that are accurate to $\sim 10\%$. The
recovered non-parametric SFHs place reasonable ($\pm 1$ dex) constraints on the
recent (< 2 Gyr) star formation in M31 and NGC 3377, both of which show
evidence of inside-out growth. The SFHs in M87 and M49 are constrained only at
the oldest ages. The pCMD technique is a promising new avenue for studying the
evolutionary history of the nearby universe, and is highly complementary to
existing stellar population modeling techniques.</p>

<p>GRB 170817A was a subluminous short gamma-ray burst detected about 1.74 s
after the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a binary neutron star (BNS)
merger. It is now understood as an off-axis event powered by the cocoon of a
relativistic jet pointing 15 to 30 degrees away from the direction of
observation. The cocoon was energized by the interaction of the incipient jet
with the non-relativistic baryon wind from the merger remnant, resulting in a
structured outflow with a narrow core and broad wings. In this paper, we couple
the observational constraints on the structured outflow with a model for the
jet-wind interaction to constrain the intrinsic properties with which the jet
was launched by the central engine, including its time delay from the merger
event. Using wind prescriptions inspired by magnetized BNS merger simulations,
we find that the jet was launched within about 0.4 s from the merger, implying
that the 1.74 s observed delay was dominated by the fireball propagation up to
the photospheric radius. We also constrain, for the first time for any
gamma-ray burst, the jet opening angle at injection and set a lower limit to
its asymptotic Lorentz factor. These findings suggest an initially
Poynting-flux dominated jet, launched via electromagnetic processes. If the jet
was powered by an accreting black hole, they also provide a significant
constraint on the survival time of the metastable neutron star remnant.</p>

<p>We consider the black hole (BH) shadow images which can be restored by data
processing and image recovery procedures in future space Very Large Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) missions. For Kerr BHs with masses and coordinates of
SgrA*, M87* and M31*, illuminated by light source behind them, we consider
three kinds of observation: the ground-based interferometer (similar to the
Event Horizon Telescope), space-ground interferometer with a satellite in
geocentric orbit and space-ground interferometer with a satellite located in
Lagrange point $L_2$. The significant difference between the images produced by
the ground-based telescope alone and the one of the space VLBI with an added
low-orbit satellite is caused by both the increased baseline and the improved
of (u,v) coverage. The near-Earth configuration of the radio interferometer for
the observation of BH shadows is the most preferable for the BH shadow
observations among considered cases. With further increasing the orbit radius
up to the Lagrange point $L_2$ the density of the (u,v) filling decreases and
the results appear less reliable. Model images for all the cases are presented.</p>

<p>Radio interferometry is the current method of choice for deep space
astronomy, but in the past few decades optical techniques have become
increasingly common. This research seeks to characterize the performance of
aperture masking interferometry in the near-infrared at small scales. A mask
containing six pairs of apertures at varying diameters and separations was
constructed for use with a 24-inch telescope at the MIT Wallace Astrophysical
Observatory. Test images of Spica and Jupiter were captured for 28 different
telescope configurations, varying aperture separation, aperture diameter,
collection wavelength, and exposure time. Lucky imaging was used to account for
atmospheric perturbations. Each image was reduced via bias and dark frames to
account for sensor noise, and then the full width at half maximum for each
image was computed and used as a proxy for maximum angular resolution. The data
imply that at small scales aperture size primarily controls the observed
maximum angular resolution, but further data are required to substantiate the
claim.</p>

number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}$, during Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN). By using the constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$, we present a
new bound on how much the observable Universe could have expanded during cosmic
inflation. The new bound is roughly four orders of magnitude more stringent
than previous bounds. We also discuss the sensitivities of the current and
planned GW observatories such as LIGO and LISA, and show that the constraints
they could impose are always less stringent than the BBN bound.</p>

<p>Stellar variability due to magnetic activity and flows at different spatial
scales strongly impacts radial velocities. This variability is seen as
oscillations, granulation, supergranulation, and meridional flows. The effect
of this latter process is poorly known but could affect exoplanet
detectability. We aim to quantify its amplitude when integrated over the disc
and its temporal variability, first for the Sun, seen with different
inclinations, and then for other solar-type stars. We used long time series of
solar latitudinal meridional circulation to reconstruct its integrated
contribution. We then used scaling laws from HD simulations relating the
amplitude of the meridional flow variability with stellar mass and rotation
rate to estimate the typical amplitude expected for other solar-type stars. We
find typical rms of the order of 0.5-0.7 m/s (edge-on) and 1.2-1.7 m/s
(pole-on) for the Sun, with a minimal jitter for an inclination of 45-55 deg.
This is significant compared to other stellar activity contributions and is
much larger than the radial-velocity signal of the Earth. The variability is
strongly related to the activity cycle. Extension to other solar-type stars
shows that the variability due to meridional flows is dominated by the
amplitude of the cycle of those stars. The meridional flow contribution
sometimes represents a high fraction of the convective blueshift inhibition
signal, especially for quiet, low-mass stars. Our study shows that these
meridional flows could be critical for exoplanet detection. Low inclinations
are more impacted than edge-on configurations, but these latter still exhibit
significant variability. Meridional flows also degrade the correlation between
radial velocities due to convective blueshift inhibition and chromospheric
activity indicators. This will make the correction from this signal challenging
for stars with no multi-cellular patterns.</p>

  Signal from Reionization</p><p>Hy Trac</p><p>['Christopher Cain', "Anson D'Aloisio", 'Vid Iršič', 'Matthew McQuinn', 'Hy Trac']</p><p>26 pages, 12 figures</p><p> updated: 2020-04-21T18:00:01Z</p>
<p>We examine the impact of the baryon-dark matter relative velocity on
intergalactic small-scale structure and the 21 cm signal during the epoch of
reionization (EoR). Streaming velocities reduced the clumping of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) on mass scales of $\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$.
This effect produced a distinct baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in
the EoR 21 cm power spectrum at wave numbers $k\sim 0.1$ h/Mpc, near which
forthcoming surveys will be most sensitive. In contrast to the highly uncertain
impact of streaming velocities on star formation, the effect on clumping can be
calculated more precisely because it is set mainly by cosmology and
straightforward gas dynamics. We quantify the latter using fully coupled
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that capture the Jeans scale of the pre-EoR
gas. The clumping factor of ionized gas is reduced by 5-10\% in regions that
had typical streaming velocities of 30 km/s at recombination. The suppression
peaks $\approx 5$ Myr after a region is reionized, but washes out within 200
Myr due to pressure smoothing of the gas. Using these results, we model the
corresponding impact on the EoR 21 cm power spectrum and find that the BAO
feature is most likely to appear early in reionization ($\approx$ 10 \%
ionization).During this phase, the signal may appear at the 1 \% (5 \%) level
at $k \sim 0.1 (0.06)$ h/\Mpc with an amplitude that varies by less than a
factor of 10 across a range of reionization histories. We also provide a simple
model for the signal originating from streaming velocity's impact on ionizing
sources, which can vary by 4 orders of magnitude depending on highly uncertain
source properties. We find that the clumping-driven signal is likely to
dominate the source-driven one unless population III star formation in halos of
masses $10^6 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ was efficient enough to drive the first 10\%
of reionization.</p>

<p>Axion--photon interactions can lead to an enhancement of the electromagnetic
field by parametric resonance in the presence of a cold axion background, for
modes with a frequency close to half the axion mass. In this paper, we study
the role of the axion momentum dispersion as well as the effects of a
background gravitational potential, which can detune the resonance due to
gravitational redshift. We show, by analytical as well as numerical
calculations, that the resonance leads to an exponential growth of the photon
field only if (a) the axion momentum spread is smaller than the inverse
resonance length, and (b) the gravitational detuning distance is longer than
the resonance length. For realistic parameter values, both effects strongly
suppress the resonance and prevent the exponential growth of the photon field.
In particular, the redshift due to the gravitational potential of our galaxy
prevents the resonance from developing for photons in the observable frequency
range, even assuming that all the dark matter consists of a perfectly cold
axion condensate. For axion clumps with masses below $\sim 10^{-13}\, M_\odot$,
the momentum spread condition is more restrictive, whereas, for more massive
clumps, the redshift condition dominates.</p>
