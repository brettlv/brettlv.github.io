<p>The engines that produce extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs), and the
mechanism by which the emission is generated, remain unknown. Many FRB models
predict prompt multi-wavelength counterparts, which can be used to refine our
knowledge of these fundamentals of the FRB phenomenon. However, several
previous targeted searches for prompt FRB counterparts have yielded no
detections, and have additionally not reached sufficient sensitivity with
respect to the predictions. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to
estimate the ratio, $\eta$, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at
various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission. Our technique combines
the fluence distribution of the FRB population with results from several
wide-field blind surveys for fast transients from the optical to the TeV bands.
We present constraints on $\eta$ that improve upon previous observations even
in the case that all unclassified transient events in existing surveys are FRB
counterparts. In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we
find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus
demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for $\eta$.
However, it is possible that FRB counterparts are lurking amongst catalogs of
unclassified transient events. Although our technique is robust to the present
uncertainty in the FRB fluence distribution, its ultimate application to
accurately estimate or bound $\eta$ will require the careful analysis of all
candidate fast-transient events in multi-wavelength survey data sets.</p>

  Fast Radio Bursts</p><p>Jun-Qing Xia</p><p>['Ji-Ping Dai', 'Jun-Qing Xia']</p><p>12 pages, 3 figures</p><p> updated: 2020-04-23T16:03:08Z</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the evolution of the ionization fraction $x_e(z)$
during the epoch of reionization by using the dispersion measures (DM) of fast
radio bursts (FRBs). Different from the previous studies, here we turn to
consider the large-scale clustering information of observed DM of FRB catalog,
which only needs the rough redshift distribution, instead of the exact redshift
information of each FRB. Firstly, we consider the instantaneous "\texttt{tanh}"
model for $x_e(z)$ and find that including the auto-correlation information of
the mock catalog, about $10^4$ FRBs with the intrinsic DM scatter of 100 $\rm
pc/cm^3$ spanning 20\% of all sky, could significantly improve the constraint
on the width $\Delta_z$ of the model, when comparing with that from the CMB
data alone. The evolution shape of the ionization fraction will be tightly
narrowed, namely the duration of the epoch of reionization has been shrunk,
$z_{\rm dur}<1.15$ (68\% C.L.). Furthermore, we also use another
redshift-asymmetric reionization model and obtain that the FRB mock catalog
could measure the ionization fraction at $z=6$ precisely with the $1\sigma$
error $\Delta x_e(z=6)=0.009$, which means that the large-scale clustering
information of observed DM of FRB catalog is very sensitive to the ionization
fraction of the end of reionization epoch. We conclude that the observation of
high-redshift FRBs could be a complementary probe to study the reionization
history in the future.</p>

<p>The prompt emission in long gamma-ray bursts arises from within relativistic
outflows created during the collapse of massive stars, and the mechanism by
which radiation is produced may be either magnetically- or matter-dominated. In
this work we suggest an observational test of a magnetically-dominated Poynting
flux model that predicts both gamma-ray and low-frequency radio pulses. A
common feature among early light curves of long gamma-ray bursts are X-ray
flares, which have been shown to arise from sites internal to the jet.
Ascribing these events to the prompt emission, we take an established Swift XRT
flare sample and apply a magnetically-dominated wind model to make predictions
for the timing and flux density of corresponding radio pulses in the ~100-200
MHz band observable with radio facilities such as LOFAR. We find that 44 per
cent of the X-ray flares studied would have had detectable radio emission under
this model, for typical sensitivities reached using LOFAR's rapid response mode
and assuming negligible absorption and scattering effects in the interstellar
and intergalactic medium. We estimate the rate of Swift gamma-ray bursts
displaying X-ray flares with detectable radio pulses, accessible to LOFAR, of
order seven per year. We determine that LOFAR triggered observations can play a
key role in establishing the long debated mechanism responsible for gamma-ray
burst prompt emission.</p>

<p>The origin of radio relics is usually explained via diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) or re-acceleration of electrons at/from merger shocks in
galaxy clusters. The case of acceleration is challenged by the low predicted
efficiency of low-Mach number merger shocks, unable to explain the power
observed in most radio relics. In this Letter we present the discovery of a new
giant radio relic around the galaxy cluster Abell 2249 ($z=0.0838$) using
LOFAR. It is special since it has the lowest surface brightness of all known
radio relics. We study its radio and X-ray properties combinig LOFAR data with
uGMRT, JVLA and XMM. This object has a total power of $L_{1.4\rm GHz}=4.1\pm
0.8 \times 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and integrated spectral index $\alpha = 1.15\pm
0.23$. We infer for this radio relic a lower bound on the magnetisation of
$B\geq 0.4\, \mu$G, a shock Mach number of $\mathcal{M}\approx 3.79$, and a low
acceleration efficiency consistent with DSA. This result suggests that a
missing population of relics may become visible thanks to the unprecedented
sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes.</p>

<p>In contrast to massive galaxies with Solar or super-Solar gas phase
metallicities, very few Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are found in
low-metallicity dwarf galaxies. Such a population could provide insight into
the origins of supermassive black holes. Here we report near-infrared
spectroscopic and X-ray observations of SDSS J105621.45+313822.1, a low-mass,
low-metallicity galaxy with optical narrow line ratios consistent with star
forming galaxies but a broad H$\alpha$ line and mid-infrared colors consistent
with an AGN. We detect the [Si VI] 1.96$\mu$m coronal line and a broad
Pa$\alpha$ line with a FWHM of $850 \pm 25$~km~s$^{-1}$. Together with the
optical broad lines and coronal lines seen in the SDSS spectrum, we confirm the
presence of a highly accreting black hole with mass $(2.2 \pm 1.3) \times
10^{6}$~M$_{\odot}$, with a bolometric luminosity of
$\approx10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ based on the coronal line luminosity, implying a
highly accreting AGN. Chandra observations reveal a weak nuclear point source
with $L_{\textrm{X,2-10 keV}} = (2.3 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{41}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,
$\sim 2$ orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by the mid-infrared
luminosity, suggesting that the AGN is highly obscured despite showing broad
lines in the optical spectrum. The low X-ray luminosity and optical narrow line
ratios of J1056+3138 highlight the limitations of commonly employed diagnostics
in the hunt for AGNs in the low metallicity low mass regime.</p>

<p>We propose a geometrical explanation about neutron star (NS)-companion system
in order to explain the periodically and nonperiodicly repeating fast radio
bursts (FRBs). We propose that there is a critical binary separation $r_{\rm
c}$ under which the interaction between the NS and its companion can trigger
FRBs. If the maximum and minimum binary separation of elliptic orbit, i.e.,
$r_{\rm max}$ and $r_{\rm min}$, satisfy $r_{\rm max}>r_{\rm c}>r_{\rm min}$,
the orbital motion of the binary can induce periodicly FRBs, and the
interaction between the NS and companion when they get close enough in their
elliptic orbit will result an active period of periodicly FRBs. If the maximum
binary separation $r_{\rm max}<r_{\rm c}$, the modulation of orbital motion
will not work since the interaction is always there, such that a repeating FRB
can be nonperiodic.</p>

<p>The observation of a radioactively-powered kilonova associated with the first
binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected in gravitational waves proved that
these events are ideal sites for the production of heavy r-process elements.
However, the physical origin of the ejected material responsible for the early
("blue") and late ("red") components of this kilonova is still debated. Here,
we investigate the possibility that the early/blue kilonova originated from the
magnetically driven baryon wind launched after merger by the metastable neutron
star remnant. Exploiting a magnetized BNS merger simulation with over 250 ms of
post-merger evolution, we can follow for the first time the full mass ejection
process up to its final decline. We find that the baryon wind carries
$\simeq\!0.010\!-\!0.028\,M_\odot$ of unbound material, proving that the high
mass estimated for the blue kilonova can be achieved. The expansion velocities
of up to 0.2 c are marginally consistent with the observational estimates and
we discuss various effects neglected here that could further improve the
current agreement. Overall, our results show that the magnetically driven
baryon wind is a viable explanation for the blue kilonova.</p>

<p>We present LOFAR observations at 150 MHz of the borderline FRI/FRII giant
radio galaxy NGC 6251. This paper presents the most sensitive and
highest-resolution images of NGC 6251 at these frequencies to date, revealing
for the first time a low-surface-brightness extension to the northern lobe, and
a possible backflow associated with the southern lobe. The integrated spectra
of components of NGC 6251 are consistent with previous measurements at higher
frequencies, similar to results from other LOFAR studies of nearby radio
galaxies. We find the outer structures of NGC 6251 to be either at
equipartition or slightly electron dominated, similar to those of FRII sources
rather than FRIs; but this conclusion remains tentative because of
uncertainties associated with the geometry and the extrapolation of X-ray
measurements to determine the external pressure distribution on the scale of
the outer lobes. We place lower limits on the ages of the extension of the
northern lobe and the backflow of the southern lobe of $t \gtrsim 250$ Myr and
$t \gtrsim 210$ Myr respectively. We present the first detection of
polarisation at 150 MHz in NGC 6251. Taking advantage of the high Faraday
resolution of LOFAR, we place an upper limit on the magnetic field in the group
of $B < 0.2 (\Lambda_B / 10 {\rm kpc})^{-0.5} \mu$G for a coherence scale of
$\Lambda_B < 60 {\rm kpc}$ and $B < 13 \mu$G for $\Lambda_B = 240$ kpc.</p>

<p>The understanding of the causes that produce the deflection of coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) is essential for the space weather forecast. In this article,
we study the effects on CMEs trajectories produced by the different properties
of a coronal hole close to the ejection area. For this analysis, we perform
numerical simulations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations that emulate
the early rising of the CME in presence of a coronal hole. We find that, the
stronger the magnetic field and the wider the coronal hole area, the larger the
CME deflection. This effect is reduced when the coronal hole moves away from
the ejection region. To characterize this behavior, we propose a dimensionless
parameter that depends on the coronal hole properties and properly quantifies
the deflection. Also, we show that the presence of the coronal hole near a CME
magnetic structure produces a minimum magnetic energy region which is
responsible for the deflection. Thus, we find a relationship between the
coronal hole properties, the location of this region and the CME deflection.</p>

<p>Associating gamma-ray sources to their low-energy counterparts is one of the
major challenges of modern gamma-ray astronomy. In the context of the Fourth
Fermi Large Area Telescope Source Catalog (4FGL), the associations rely mainly
on parameters as apparent magnitude, integrated flux, and angular separation
between the gamma-ray source and its low-energy candidate counterpart. In this
work we propose a new use of likelihood ratio and a complementary supervised
learning technique to associate gamma-ray blazars in 4FGL, based only on
spectral parameters as gamma-ray photon index, mid-infrared colors and
radio-loudness. In the likelihood ratio approach, we crossmatch the WISE
Blazar-Like Radio-Loud Sources catalog with 4FGL and compare the resulting
candidate counterparts with the sources listed in the gamma-ray blazar locus to
compute an association probability for 1138 counterparts. In the supervised
learning approach, we train a random forest algorithm with 869 high confidence
blazar associations and 711 fake associations, and then compute an association
probability for 1311 candidate counterparts. A list with all 4FGL blazar
candidates of uncertain type associated by our method is provided to guide
future optical spectroscopic follow up observations.</p>

<p>Numerical relativity predicts that the coalescence of a black hole-binary
causes the newly formed black hole to recoil, and evidence for such recoils has
been found in the gravitational waves observed during the merger of
stellar-mass black holes. Recoiling (super)massive black holes are expected to
reside in hypercompact stellar clusters (HCSCs). Simulations of galaxy assembly
predict that hundreds of HCSCs should be present in the halo of a Milky
Way-type galaxy, and a fraction of those around the Milky Way should have
magnitudes within the sensitivity limit of existing surveys. However, recoiling
black holes and their HCSCs are still waiting to be securely identified. With
the goal of enabling searches through recent and forthcoming databases, we
improve over existing literature to produce realistic renditions of HCSCs bound
to black holes with a mass of 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. Including the effects of a
population of blue stragglers, we simulate their appearance in Pan-STARRS and
in forthcoming $Euclid$ images. We also derive broad-band spectra and the
corresponding multi-wavelength colours, finding that the great majority of the
simulated HCSCs fall on the colour-colour loci defined by stars and galaxies,
with their spectra resembling those of giant K-type stars. We discuss the
clusters properties, search strategies, and possible interlopers.</p>

<p>The recurrent nova (RN) V3890 Sgr was observed during the 7th day after the
onset of its most recent outburst, with the Chandra ACIS-S camera and High
Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG). A rich emission line spectrum was
detected, due to transitions of Fe-L and K-shell ions ranging from neon to
iron. The measured absorbed flux is $\approx 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
in the 1.4-15 Angstrom range (0.77-8.86 keV). The line profiles are asymmetric,
blue-shifted and skewedtowards the blue side, as if the ejecta moving towards
us are less absorbed than the receding ones. The full width at half maximum of
most emission lines is 1000-1200 km s$^{-1}$, with some extended blue wings.
The spectrum is thermal and consistent with a plasma in collisional ionization
equilibrium with column density 1.3 $\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and at least two
components at temperatures of about 1 keV and 4 keV, possibly a forward and a
reverse shock, or regions with differently mixed ejecta and red giant wind. The
spectrum is remarkably similar to the symbiotic RNe V745 Sco and RS Oph, but we
cannot distinguish whether the shocks occurred at a distance of few AU from the
red giant, or near the giant's photosphere, in a high density medium containing
only a small mass. The ratios of the flux in lines of aluminum, magnesium and
neon relative to the flux in lines of silicon and iron probably indicate a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD).</p>

<p>Black hole X-ray binaries show signs of non-thermal emission in the
optical/near-infrared range. We analyze the optical/near-infrared SMARTS data
on GX339$-$4 over the 2002--2011 period. Using the soft state data, we estimate
the interstellar extinction towards the source and characteristic color
temperatures of the accretion disk. We show that various spectral states of
regular outbursts occupy similar regions on the color-magnitude diagrams, and
that transitions between the states proceed along the same tracks despite
substantial differences in the observed light curves morphology. We determine
the typical duration of the hard-to-soft and soft-to-hard state transitions and
the hard state at the decaying stage of the outburst to be one, two and four
weeks, respectively. We find that the failed outbursts cannot be easily
distinguished from the regular ones at their early stages, but if the source
reaches 16 mag in $V$-band, it will transit to the soft state. By subtracting
the contribution of the accretion disk, we obtain the spectra of the
non-thermal component, which have constant, nearly flat shape during the
transitions between the hard and soft states. In contrast to the slowly
evolving non-thermal component seen at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,
the mid-infrared spectrum is strongly variable on short timescales and
sometimes shows a prominent excess with a cutoff below $10^{14}$ Hz. We show
that the radio to optical spectrum can be modeled using three components
corresponding to the jet, hot flow and irradiated accretion disk.</p>

<p>Supermassive binary black holes at sub-parsec orbital separations have yet to
be discovered. In parallel with the global hunt for nanohertz gravitational
waves from such binaries using pulsar timing arrays, there has been a growing
sample of candidates reported from electromagnetic surveys, particularly
searches for periodic variations in optical light curves of quasars. However,
the periodicity search is prone to false positives from quasar red noise,
especially when the data span is less than a few signal cycles. Here we present
a Bayesian method for the detection of quasar periodicity in the presence of
red noise. We apply this method to the binary candidate PG1302$-$102, using
data from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, the All-Sky Automated Survey
for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) and the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research. We show
that a) there is very strong support---with a Bayes factor greater than
$10^5$---for periodicity, despite the fact that the inclusion of ASAS-SN data
reduces the detection significance, and b) the prevalent damped random walk
red-noise model is disfavored with more than 99\% credibility. We discuss
practical aspects of a periodicity search in time-series data and implications
for the binary black hole nature of PG1302$-$102. Finally, we outline future
work that may enable the unambiguous identification of supermassive binary
black holes.</p>

<p>The manifestation of the dark Universe begun with unexpected large scale
astronomical observations. Here we are investigating the origin of small scale
anomalies, like that of the annually observed temperature anomalies in the
stratosphere. Unexpectedly, we observe a planetary relationship of the daily
stratospheric temperature distribution. Its spectral shape does not match
concurrent solar activity, or solar EUV emission, whose impact on the
atmosphere is unequivocal. This behavior points at an additional energy source
of exosolar origin. A viable concept behind such observations is based on
possible gravitational focusing by the solar system towards the Earth of low
speed invisible matter. We denote generic constituents from the dark Universe
as invisible matter, in order to distinguish them from ordinary dark matter
candidates like axions or WIMPs, which cannot have any noticeable impact on the
stratosphere. The observed peaking planetary relations exclude on their own any
conventional explanation. Only a somehow strongly interacting invisible
streaming matter with the little screened upper stratosphere (noverhead about 1
gr/cm 2) can be behind the occasionally observed temperature increases. We also
estimate an associated energy deposition O(W/m 2), which is variable over the
11 years solar cycle. For the widely assumed picture of a quasi not interacting
dark Universe, this new exosolar energy is enormous. Since the atmosphere is
uninterruptedly monitored since decades, it can serve also parasitically as a
novel low threshold detector for the dark Universe, with built-in
spatiotemporal resolution and the solar system acting temporally as signal
amplifier. In future, analyzing more observations, for example, from the
anomalous ionosphere, or, the transient sudden stratospheric warmings, the
nature of the assumed invisible streams could be deciphered.</p>

<p>This paper is an overview of the author's PhD thesis results. ARGO-YBJ is an
extensive air shower detector located at Yangbajing (Tibet, China) at 4300 m
a.s.l. It is made by a full coverage carpet plus a guard ring (total surface
about 6700 m^2) of Resistive Plate Chambers grouped into 153 units called
clusters. The experiment has two different operation modes. The former, the
scaler mode, counts the number of events with particle multiplicity >=1, >=2,
>=3, >=4 allowing to reach the lowest energy threshold of the detector (few
GeVs). The latter, the shower mode, measures coordinates and arrival time of
each particle hitting the carpet for a complete shower reconstruction at an
energy threshold of few hundreds of GeVs. Due to the high sensitivity of scaler
mode it becomes very important remove all environmental parameter effects from
scaler counts. The careful study of cosmic ray variations with environmental
variables (such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, local radioactivity)
allowed the correct estimation of the significance of signals registered in
scaler mode. Episodes of counting rate variations both in scaler and shower
mode in correspondence to high electric field variations are discussed,
together with the study of temporal and spatial characteristics of cosmic ray
showers during thunderstorms.</p>

<p>The emission from the relativistic jets in blazars usually outshines their
host galaxies, challenging the determination of their distances and the
characterization of the stellar population. The situation becomes more
favorable in the case of the extreme blazars (EHBLs), for which the bulk of the
emission of the relativistic jets is emitted at higher energies, unveiling the
optical emission from the host galaxy. The distance determination is
fundamental for the study of the intrinsic characteristics of the blazars,
especially to estimate the intrinsic gamma-ray spectra distorted due to the
interaction with the Extragalactic Background Light. In this work we report on
the properties of 2WHSP~J073326.7+515354 host galaxy in the optical band, which
is one of the few EHBLs detected at TeV energies. We present the first
measurement of the distance of the source, $\mathrm{z}=0.06504\pm0.00002$
(velocity dispersion $\sigma=237 \pm 9\,\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$). We also perform a
detailed study of the stellar population of its host galaxy. We find that the
mass-weighted mean stellar age is $11.72\pm0.06\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ and the mean
metallicity $[M/H]=0.159 \pm 0.016$. In addition, a morphological study of the
host galaxy is also carried out. The surface brightness distribution is
modelled by a composition of a dominant classical bulge ($R_e=3.77\pm1\arcsec $
or equivalently 4.74~kpc) plus an unresolved source which corresponds to the
active nucleus. The black hole mass is estimated using both the mass relation
with the velocity dispersion and the absolute magnitude from the bulge yielding
comparable results: $(4.8\pm0.9)\times10^8\,M_{\odot}$ and
$(3.7\pm1.0)\times10^8\,M_{\odot}$, respectively.</p>

<p>We report the discovery and validation of four extrasolar planets hosted by
the nearby, bright, Sun-like (G3V) star HD~108236 using data from the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We present transit photometry,
reconnaissance and precise Doppler spectroscopy as well as high-resolution
imaging, to validate the planetary nature of the objects transiting HD~108236,
also known as the TESS Object of Interest (TOI) 1233. The innermost planet is a
possibly-rocky super-Earth with a period of $3.79523_{-0.00044}^{+0.00047}$
days and has a radius of $1.586\pm0.098$ $R_\oplus$. The outer planets are
sub-Neptunes, with potential gaseous envelopes, having radii of
$2.068_{-0.091}^{+0.10}$ $R_\oplus$, $2.72\pm0.11$ $R_\oplus$, and
$3.12_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ $R_\oplus$ and periods of
$6.20370_{-0.00052}^{+0.00064}$ days, $14.17555_{-0.0011}^{+0.00099}$ days, and
$19.5917_{-0.0020}^{+0.0022}$ days, respectively. With V and K$_{\rm s}$
magnitudes of 9.2 and 7.6, respectively, the bright host star makes the
transiting planets favorable targets for mass measurements and, potentially,
for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy. HD~108236 is
the brightest Sun-like star in the visual (V) band known to host four or more
transiting exoplanets. The discovered planets span a broad range of planetary
radii and equilibrium temperatures, and share a common history of insolation
from a Sun-like star ($R_\star = 0.888 \pm 0.017$ R$_\odot$, $T_{\rm eff} =
5730 \pm 50$ K), making HD 108236 an exciting, opportune cosmic laboratory for
testing models of planet formation and evolution.</p>

<p>We show that highly spinning primordial black holes of mass $M\sim 10^{12}$
kg, potentially born in a matter-dominated era after inflation, can produce
clouds of pions in their vicinity via the superradiant instability, with
densities up to that of nuclear matter. We discuss the electromagnetic
signatures of this process, via neutral pion decay and charged pion
annihilation into photons, computing in particular their contribution to the
isotropic gamma-ray background. This allows us to place upper bounds on the
abundance of such primordial black holes that are comparable to the ones
obtained from Hawking evaporation. We also discuss the possibility of directly
observing such clouds in high-redshift superclusters.</p>

<p>Properties of plasmoid-dominated turbulent reconnection in a low-$\beta$
background plasma are investigated by resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. In the $\beta_{\rm in} < 1$ regime, where $\beta_{\rm in}$ is
plasma $\beta$ in the inflow region, the reconnection site is dominated by
shocks and shock-related structures and plasma compression is significant. The
effective reconnection rate increases from $0.01$ to $0.02$ as $\beta_{\rm in}$
decreases. We hypothesize that plasma compression allows faster reconnection
rate, and then we estimate a speed-up factor, based on a compressible MHD
theory. We validate our prediction by a series of MHD simulations. These
results suggest that the plasmoid-dominated reconnection can be twice faster
than expected in the $\beta \ll 1$ environment in a solar corona.</p>

<p>Dark matter may consist, at least partially, of primordial black holes formed
during the radiation-dominated era. The radiation produced by accretion onto
primordial black holes leaves characteristic signatures on the properties of
the medium at high redshift, before and after Hydrogen recombination.
Therefore, reliable modelling of accretion onto these objects is required to
obtain robust constraints on their abundance. We investigate the effect of
mechanical feedback, i.e. the impact of outflows (winds and/or jets) on the
medium, on primordial black hole accretion, and thereby on the associated
radiation. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we study for the first
time whether outflows can reduce the accretion rate of primordial black holes
with masses similar to those detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Despite
the complexity of the accretion rate evolution, mechanical feedback is able to
significantly reduce the primordial black hole accretion rate, at least by an
order of magnitude, when outflows are aligned with the motion of the compact
object. If the outflow is perpendicular to the direction of motion, the effect
is less important but still non-negligible. Outflows from primordial black
holes, even rather weak ones, can significantly decrease the accretion rate,
effectively weakening abundance constraints on these objects. Our results
motivate further numerical simulations with a more realistic setup, which would
yield more precise quantitative predictions.</p>

<p>We present X-ray imaging spectroscopy of one of the weakest active region
(AR) microflares ever studied. The microflare occurred at $\sim$11:04 UT on
2018 September 9 and we studied it using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope
ARray (NuSTAR) and the Solar Dynamic Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(SDO/AIA). The microflare is observed clearly in 2.5-7 keV with NuSTAR and in
Fe XVIII emission derived from the hotter component of the 94 $\unicode{x212B}$
SDO/AIA channel. We estimate the event to be three orders of magnitude lower
than a GOES A class microflare with an energy of 1.1$\times$10$^{26}$ erg. It
reaches temperatures of 6.7 MK with an emission measure of 8.0$\times$10$^{43}$
cm$^{-3}$. Non-thermal emission is not detected but we instead determine upper
limits to such emission. We present the lowest thermal energy estimate for an
AR microflare in literature, which is at the lower limits of what is still
considered an X-ray microflare.</p>

<p>We investigate the enrichment patterns of several delivery scenarios of the
volatiles to the atmospheres of ice giants, having in mind that the only well
constrained determination made remotely, i.e. the carbon abundance measurement,
suggests that their envelopes possess highly supersolar metallicities, i.e.
close to two orders of magnitude above that of the protosolar nebula. In the
framework of the core accretion model, only the delivery of volatiles in solid
forms (amorphous ice, clathrates, pure condensates) to these planets can
account for the apparent supersolar metallicity of their envelopes. In
contrast, because of the inward drift of icy particles through various
snowlines, all mechanisms invoking the delivery of volatiles in vapor forms
predict subsolar abundances in the envelopes of Uranus and Neptune.
Alternatively, even if the disk instability mechanism remains questionable in
our solar system, it might be consistent with the supersolar metallicities
observed in Uranus and Neptune, assuming the two planets suffered subsequent
erosion of their H-He envelopes. The enrichment patterns derived for each
delivery scenario considered should be useful to interpret future in situ
measurements by atmospheric entry probes.</p>

<p>We present $UBVRI$ photometry of 8702 stars in a $0.5 ^\circ\times0.5 ^\circ$
field in the direction of NGC 7142, taken with the Half Degree Imager (HDI) at
the WIYN 0.9-meter telescope, to improve knowledge of this cluster's basic
parameters. Our photometry spans the ranges 10.6 - 20.4 mag in $U$, 10.6 - 22.0
mag in $B$, 10.0 - 21.8 mag in $V$, 9.2 - 20.7 mag in $R$, and 8.5 - 19.9 mag
in $I$. Using color-color diagrams that employ all four color combinations that
include $U$, versus $B-V$, we derive a reddening-metallicity relation for the
cluster, with preferred values $E(B-V$) = 0.338 $\pm$ 0.031 mag for the
left-edge fiducial of the main sequence and [Fe/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.1 dex, where
the Hyades cluster has been used as an unreddened reference cluster, the
extinction relations of Cardelli have been employed, and the metallicity
dependence of the Yonsei-Yale ($Y^2$) isochrones has been assumed. Comparison
of our data to the $Y^2$ isochrones in multiple color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
yields distance-metallicity and age-metallicity relations, with preferred
values of $m-M\ =\ 12.65\ \pm\ 0.23$ mag and age = $4.0 ^{-0.7}_{+1.3}$ Gyr.
Re-evaluation of the parameters of M67 using Stetson's $UBVI$ photometry yields
[Fe/H] = -0.02 $\pm$ 0.05 dex, $E(B-V$) = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.01 mag, $m-M$ = 9.75
$\pm$ 0.03 mag, and age = 3.85 $\pm$ 0.17 Gyr; we thus find the metallicity and
age of the two clusters to be indistinguishable. A semi-independent analysis
adopting the parameters of M67 and shifting the fiducials of the two clusters
in six CMDs until they match strongly corroborates the values listed above. The
differences between our inferred parallaxes and the Gaia DR2 values are $87\
\pm\ 60$ $\mu$as for NGC 7142 and 48 $\pm$ 15 $\mu$as for M67, consistent with
previous studies.</p>

<p>We present the detection and characterization of the full-orbit phase curve
and secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b at optical wavelengths,
along with the pulsation spectrum of the host star. We analyzed data collected
by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during Sector 18. WASP-33b
belongs to a very short list of highly irradiated exoplanets that were
discovered from the ground and were afterwards visited by TESS. WASP-33b's host
star, of delta Scuti type, shows non-radial pulsations in the milli-magnitude
regime, with periods comparable to that of the primary transit. Carrying out a
detailed determination of the pulsation spectrum of the host star, we find 29
pulsation frequencies with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 4. After
cleaning the light curve for the stellar pulsations we confidently report a
secondary eclipse depth of 305.8 +/- 35.5 parts-per-million (ppm), along with
an amplitude of the phase curve of 100.4 +/- 13.1 ppm and a corresponding
westward offset between the region of maximum brightness and the substellar
point of 28.7 +/- 7.1 degrees, making WASP-33b one of the few planets with such
an offset found so far. Our derived Bond albedo, A_B = 0.369 +/- 0.050, and
heat recirculation efficiency, epsilon = 0.189 +/- 0.014, reconfirm WASP-33b to
be similar in behaviour to other hot Jupiters, despite the high irradiation
received from its host star. Connecting the amplitude of the phase curve to the
primary transit and secondary eclipse depths, we determine the day and night
side brightness temperatures of WASP-33b to be 3014 +/- 60 K and 1605 +/- 45 K,
respectively. From the detection of photometric variations due to gravitational
interactions, we estimated a planet mass of M_P = 2.81 +/- 0.53 M_Jup.
Analyzing the stellar pulsations in the frame of the planetary orbit, we find
no signals of star-planet interactions.</p>
